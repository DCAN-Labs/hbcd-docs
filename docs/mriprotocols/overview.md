# Overview

The HBCD MRI protocol includes structural MRI, functional MRI, diffusion MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and quantitative relaxometry on Siemens, GE, and Philips MRI scanners. Per [Dean et al (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929324001130):

>*The majority of pulse sequences used for the HBCD MRI protocol are research-specific and some require signing transfer agreements with the academic centers at which the sequences were developed. While our goal was to use product sequences where possible, the decision to use research-specific pulse sequences was motivated by the desire to take advantage of additional non-product features (e.g., motion-tracking navigators) and/or the need for modifications to better harmonize across all three vendors (e.g., ensuring similar RF pulse shapes and timings).* 

Here we describe how to obtain and install the relevant sequences for your system as well as provide Scanning SOPs and other relevant resources provided to HBCD study sites. Please review for [Dean et al (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929324001130) for comprehensive details on the magnetic resonance protocols included.
