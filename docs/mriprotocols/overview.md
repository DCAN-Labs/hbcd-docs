# Overview

The HBCD MRI protocol includes structural MRI, functional MRI, diffusion MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and quantitative relaxometry on Siemens, GE, and Philips MRI scanners. This section will describe how to obtain and install the relevant sequences for your system. It will also contain Scanning SOPs and other relevant resources provided to HBCD study sites. 

Comprehensive details on the magnetic resonance protocols are included in [Dean et al (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929324001130).
