# Siemens Protocol v2.2 (XA30)

## Installation Instructions
Before importing the HBCD protocol, please ensure you have received and installed the necessary C2P sequence packages for access to the latest versions of each sequence. Without the C2P packages installed, the full protocol cannot be imported.

**IMPORTANT DIRECTIONS BEFORE SEQUENCE INSTALLATION:** Siemens has identified a bug in NXVA30A SP02 (the software baseline used for this study) that may cause your scanner to become non-responsive during the installation of the certificates required for custom sequences. Please ensure you have SP02 SD05 installed on your scanner before proceeding, as this fixes the bug and allows you to install custom sequences.
