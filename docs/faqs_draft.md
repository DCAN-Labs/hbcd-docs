<p>"In general, each person is able to get their own data access, but you may also list collaborators on a “Parent” DUC that then grants access to the data to all collaborators listed on the DUC. That said, it is up to your institution to determine whether they will “co-sign” an independent DUC for a student, though generally graduate students, postdocs, etc., have been able to have their own DUC. Some groups have the PI submit a DUC with trainees and other lab members listed as collaborators. If you go that route, then you just need to make sure the primary DUC holder doesn’t forget to renew their DUC annually, otherwise all others on the DUC will lose access along with them when it expires. </p>
<p>If you go this route of having one DUC with collaborators listed, be sure that all collaborators also have NDA accounts, and list their email addresses associated with their NDA account, because that way when the DUC is approved by NDA, those people will be able to access the downloads themselves."<p>
