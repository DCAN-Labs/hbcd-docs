### Potential Issues Flagged by Subject Matter Experts
* Medication was queried from the RxNORM database. Reasons for medication use are captured from ICD codes (from BioPortal ICD), which were at times difficult for the participant to name or the RA to correctly find in the ICD database. This was apparent with aspirin used for preeclampsia, as there was not an option for coding preventive use. Aspirin was specifically moved to the prenatal vitamin section a few months into the study. Additionally, medications used PRN were difficult for the participant to report. Finally, although not asked, some medications were coded with the dose in the database, although this was not asked and should not be used.

## APA 1/2
### Overview
**Full Name**: DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 and Level 2 (version 8a) Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure—Adult   
**Acronym/Brief Name**: APA 1/2  
**Construct**: Mental health   
**Description**: This was a created to capture maternal mental health  
**Summary**: This is a highly sensitive screening tool for use in community samples. This mental health screening instrument has two levels. Level 1 includes one to two questions for each of thirteen mental health conditions. When symptoms were reported for Level 1, the participant answered several subsequent questions, which asked about additional symptoms associated with each mental health condition, including anger, anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms, and sleep problems. Slight modifications were made due to the use of other measures and the study population. Specifically, the level 1 questions for personality functioning and substance use were not included; participants proceed automatically to level 2 measures. In addition, all participants answer the level 1 questions on depression but proceed to level 2 questions irrespective of answers.

## NSESSS—PTSD and NSESSS—Acute Stress Disorder
### Overview
**Full Name**: Severity of Posttraumatic/Acute Stress Symptoms- National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scale (NSESSS) and National Stressful Events Survey Acute Stress Disorder Short Scale (NSESSS)  
**Acronym/Brief Name**: NSESSS—PTSD and NSESSS—Acute Stress Disorder  
**Construct**: PTSD/acute stress disorder symptom severity  
**Description**: This measure was created to capture maternal PTSD and acute stress symptoms  
**Summary**: The Severity of Posttraumatic/Acute Stress Symptoms is a measure that assesses the severity of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder in individuals ages 18 and older following an extremely stressful event or experience. Items 1-9 from the National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scale (NSESSS—PTSD) and Item 3 from the National Stressful Events Survey Acute Stress Disorder Short Scale (NSESSS—Acute Stress Disorder) were combined into a single assessment for the HBCD study to capture the severity of maternal posttraumatic/acute stress symptoms.

This measure is a combination of two measures: the Severity of Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms—Adult\* National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scale (NSESSS-PTSD) (questions 1-9) [**https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA\_DSM5\_Severity-of-Posttraumatic-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf**](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Posttraumatic-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf)

And the Severity of Acute Stress Symptoms—Adult\* National Stressful Events Survey Acute Stress Disorder Short Scale (NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder) (question 3\) [**https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA\_DSM5\_Severity-of-Acute-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf**](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Acute-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf)

The NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder is a 7-item scale, 6 of which are the same questions from the PTSD short scale, with one additional unique question. 

Please note that scores on these scales will not differentiate between symptoms of PTSD versus Acute Stress Disorder, but rather, both assess for trauma-related stress symptoms, and researchers should review the individual items to determine which scale best meets their interest.

**Thus, the scales are as follows:**

| Total Raw Score Acute Stress (Total of Questions 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10\) |
| :---- |
| Total Raw Score PTSD (Total of Questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\) |

## ASSIST V1
### Overview
**Full Name**: NIDA-modified Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) V2.0  
**Acronym/Brief Name**: ASSIST V1  
**Construct**: Substance use before and during pregnancy  
**Description**: This was a created to capture maternal substance use before, during and after pregnancy  
**Summary**: Lifetime and problematic use, pre-pregnancy and pregnancy use was expanded into the following substances: nicotine or tobacco products, alcohol, cannabis, cannabidiol, synthetic cannabinoids, prescription opioids, heroin or other illicit opioids, methadone, buprenorphine, benzodiazepines, cocaine, amphetamine type stimulants, methamphetamine, inhalants, hallucinogens or club drugs, androgenic anabolic steroids, phencyclidine, and kratom. Participants were asked for each substance whether they had ever used it, and for those endorsed, a series of questions about disordered use or use causing problems in their lives. Information was obtained about modes of use specific to each substance. For example, for tobacco, participants were asked to report the type of product used, such as cigarettes or e-cigarettes. Likewise, participants who used cannabis were asked what types of products they used, such as smoking marijuana flower, vaping, or consuming edibles. If alcohol was reported during this period, the participant was further asked what type of alcohol they consumed (beer, hard cider, hard seltzer/wine/spirits). For each one, they were asked, on average, the volume of one typical glass/container that they consumed. United States defined ‘standard drinks’ were then calculated by dividing the amount reported by 12oz (beer, hard cider, hard seltzer), 5oz (wine) or 1.5 oz (spirits). Finally, if the participant reported opioids, they were asked the type of opioid used during the period, and typical quantities per occasion for the following: heroin (grams, bags), prescription opioids (pills), buprenorphine (pills, injectables, films), and methadone (mg). Any endorsement of substances in the 3 months prior to pregnancy or during pregnancy triggered the Time Line Follow Back (TLFB).

**REDCap Form Name**: Assist V1 
**Pilot Data Dictionary**:   
**Spanish Translation**: Created  
**Child Specific/Unspecific Form**: Unspecific

### Data Collection
**Visits Administered and corresponding age range of administration**:  V1
**Estimated length of time for completion**: 5 minutes

### Quality Control (QC) Processes
**QC Procedures**: Distributions for answers, cross with TLFB   
**Common Issues Identified**: If a participant endorsed a substance on the TLFB, it should have been noted on the Assist. Sometimes it was not, which triggered a query to the site to correct it.

### Potential Issues Flagged by Subject Matter Experts
* To capture ‘standard drinks’ of alcohol, participants were asked to self-report their typical size of a single drink (in oz). This was difficult for some participants, and some reports are outside of expected range. Sites were queried on outliers, but participants were not always able to be re-contacted.

**Description**: This was a created to capture maternal substance use between enrollment and delivery and postnatal (weeks 0-4) substance use.  
**Summary**: Participants were first asked to update whether they had used any of the 18 substances of interest between V1 and delivery. If alcohol was reported during this period, the participant was further asked what type of alcohol they consumed (beer, hard cider, hard seltzer/wine/spirits). For each one, they were asked, on average, the volume of one typical glass/container that they consumed.

## Timeline Follow Back 
**Full Name**: Timeline Follow Back  
**Acronym/Brief Name**: TLFB  
**Construct**: Substance use before and during pregnancy  
**Description**: This was a created to capture maternal substance use before and during pregnancy  
**Summary**: Participants who reported any substance use in the three months before or during pregnancy were interviewed about their use of each substance with a TLFB approach.  They were instructed to report their substance use during 9 weeks in total for each substance reported on the ASSIST, disaggregated into product type (e.g. edible cannabis products). The number of occasions of use per day was captured for all products except for cigarettes and cigarillos (number per day) and alcohol (number of single servings per day). The sampled weeks captured 9 weeks in total and were as follows: pre-pregnancy use (Weeks 1-2: four weeks before LMP through two weeks before LMP), early pregnancy use (Weeks 3-6: two weeks after LMP through six weeks after LMP), and current use (Week 7: the week prior to V1). The TLFB was repeated at V2 to capture substance use during the last two full weeks of gestation (Weeks 8-9). While for most participants, the TLFB was administered by study staff, at the site where prenatal substance use was reportable by study staff, participants received training to enter their use directly into the TLFB.

**Common Issues Identified**: If a participant endorsed a substance on the TLFB, it should have been noted on the Assist. Sometimes it was not, which triggered a query to the site to correct it.

### Potential Issues Flagged by Subject Matter Experts
* Important note for users: the TLFB was a sampling of weeks of use before (Weeks 1-2) and during (Weeks 3-9) pregnancy. It is completely reasonable that someone could endorse a substance during pregnancy, and it doesn’t appear on the TLFB because it didn’t happen to fall within a sampled week. Similarly, they may have a positive biospecimen but no data on the TLFB for the same reason. Sampling (before, early, mid and late pregnancy) was meant to minimize participant burden (and not request a 40-week TLFB) but capture portions of pregnancy where behaviors tend to change (before and after pregnancy recognition, late pregnancy).
