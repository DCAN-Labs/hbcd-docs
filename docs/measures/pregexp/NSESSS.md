# NSESSS—PTSD and NSESSS—Acute Stress Disorder
## Measure Overview
**Full Name**: Severity of Posttraumatic/Acute Stress Symptoms- National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scale (NSESSS-PTSD) and National Stressful Events Survey Acute Stress Disorder Short Scale (NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder)  
**Acronym/Brief Name**: NSESSS—PTSD and NSESSS—Acute Stress Disorder  
**Construct**: PTSD/acute stress disorder symptom severity  

**Description**     
This measure was created to capture maternal PTSD and acute stress symptoms  

**General Scoring Description and Procedure**       
This measure is a combination of questions 1-9 from [NSESSS-PTSD](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Posttraumatic-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf) and question 3 from [NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Acute-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf) (the remaining 6 items of the 7-item Acute Stress Disorder scale are the same as those from the PTSD short scale).

Note that scores on these scales do not differentiate between symptoms of PTSD versus Acute Stress Disorder, but rather assess for trauma-related stress symptoms. As such, researchers should review the individual items to determine which scale best meets their interest. Total raw scores for each scale are computed as follows:

- Total Raw Score Acute Stress: sum of scores from questions 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, and 10
- Total Raw Score PTSD: sum of scores from questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9

**Summary**     
The Severity of Posttraumatic/Acute Stress Symptoms is a measure that assesses the severity of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder in individuals ages 18 and older following an extremely stressful event or experience. Items 1-9 from the National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scale (NSESSS—PTSD) and Item 3 from the National Stressful Events Survey Acute Stress Disorder Short Scale (NSESSS—Acute Stress Disorder) were combined into a single assessment for the HBCD study to capture the severity of maternal posttraumatic/acute stress symptoms.
