This measure is a combination of two measures: the Severity of Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms—Adult* National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scale (NSESSS-PTSD) (questions 1-9) [**https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Posttraumatic-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf**](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Posttraumatic-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf)

And the Severity of Acute Stress Symptoms—Adult* National Stressful Events Survey Acute Stress Disorder Short Scale (NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder) (question 3) [**https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Acute-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf**](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Acute-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf)

The NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder is a 7-item scale, 6 of which are the same questions from the PTSD short scale, with one additional unique question. 

Please note that scores on these scales will not differentiate between symptoms of PTSD versus Acute Stress Disorder, but rather, both assess for trauma-related stress symptoms, and researchers should review the individual items to determine which scale best meets their interest.

**Thus, the scales are as follows:**

| Total Raw Score Acute Stress (Total of Questions 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10) |
| :---- |
| Total Raw Score PTSD (Total of Questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) |
