<p>When writing about mental health symptoms or diagnoses, it is important to use person-centered language. One exception to this is in the area of autism, where there is ongoing dialogue within the affected community about preferred language. It is important to take guidance from those with lived experiences and professional stakeholders when considering any language. Please see the following resources:</p>

</ul>

<p>Many mental health diagnoses and experiences with mental health care can be influenced by cultural and structural factors that could impact the interpretation of items (symptoms), as well as influenced by previous diagnoses assigned by providers outside the ABCD Study. These cultural and structural factors should be acknowledged, as appropriate.</p>

<p>We recommend statistically examining measurement invariance in mental health measures, considering whether scales and individual items function similarly across demographic groups, and carefully considering the use of measures when bias is demonstrated. It is important for researchers to explicitly acknowledge: (1) potential sources of bias, (2) issues with the measure given evidence of measurement invariance, and/or (3) interpretation limitations that may stem from the use of a given measure.</p>

<p>We recommend following these recommendations for the responsible use and communication of race and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01608-4">ethnicity</a>.</p>

## Implementation & Data Collection
Surveys were translated to Spanish for HBCD by [BURG Translations](https://burgtranslations.com/our-services/). All are child-unspecific and were self-administered either in-person or remote with the exception of FAM MH, which was only self-administered in-person. Additional information is as follows:

## Quality Control
For all mental health instruments, response distributions were reviewed for outliers and no common issues were identified. No potential issues were flagged by subject matter experts.

## Instrument Details
### Personal & Family Psychiatric History 
The HBCD FAM MH assesses self-reported diagnoses and mental health conditions of the biologic mother, father, maternal parents and paternal parents. It was created from combining and modifying the [Family History Assessment Module (FHAM)](https://arc.psych.wisc.edu/self-report/family-history-assessment-module-fham/) and the [All of Us Personal and Family Health History](https://www.researchallofus.org/wp-content/themes/research-hub-wordpress-theme/media/2023/PaFHH_Survey_English.pdf). The HBCD FAM MH includes (1) FHAM items Alcohol-Schizophrenia and (2) All of Us mental health outcomes for AUD, anxiety, ASD, BPD, depression, SUD, schizophrenia and ADHD (excluding age of diagnosis or medications to treat). Future publications should note that this measure is a combination of these and that this is not a scored scale, but simply descriptive for family history.

### APA 1/2
This highly sensitive screening tool adapted for HBCD is designed for community samples and combines two measures: the [DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure—Adult](https://www.psychiatry.org/getmedia/e0b4b299-95b3-407b-b8c2-caa871ca218d/APA-DSM5TR-Level1MeasureAdult.pdf) and the DSM-5 Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures (below):

![](images/DSM-5Level2Cross-CuttingSymptomMeasures.png)

**Level 1** includes 1-2 questions for each of thirteen mental health conditions. If symptoms are reported in Level 1, participants answer questions about additional symptoms associated with each mental health condition, including anger, anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms, and sleep problems (see scoring procedures [here](https://www.psychiatry.org/getmedia/e0b4b299-95b3-407b-b8c2-caa871ca218d/APA-DSM5TR-Level1MeasureAdult.pdf)). 


**Level 2** measures include all [Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/educational-resources/assessment-measures) with the exception of Depression and Sleep Disturbance, for which the **PROMIS Short Forms v1.0** [Depression 8a questionnaire](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/toolkit_content/supplemental_info/psychiatric/measures/07_Depressed_Mood.doc&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjyl8-7t_-IAxW7H0QIHcyBJTEQFnoECC8QAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw1dPWhSyXkbVCQ3BgmjwAtC) and [Sleep Disturbance 8a](https://heal.nih.gov/files/CDEs/2024-07/promis-sleep-disturbance-8a-crf.pdf) were used instead (see Sleep Disturbance scoring procedures [here](https://www.healthmeasures.net/images/PROMIS/manuals/Scoring_Manual_Only/PROMIS_Sleep_Scoring_Manual.pdf))

Finally, the HBCD measure also integrates the [Personality Inventory for DSM-5 Brief](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_The-Personality-Inventory-For-DSM-5-Brief-Form-Adult.pdf), which assesses 5 personality trait domains including negative affect, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition, and psychoticism, with each trait domain consisting of 5 items.

Additional modifications are described below. Future publications should be sure to acknowledge the removal of Level 1-2 substance use (section XIII) and the gating mechanisms for sections V (somatic symptoms) and XII (personality functioning):

<div class="notification-collapsible-content">
<br>
<p style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>Excluded Questions and Gating</b></p>
<p>Modifications were made to adjust to the study population as well as remove items addressed in other measures. This included removing Level 1 questions related to personality functioning and Level 1-2 substance use, allowing automatic progression to LEVEL 2-Repetitive Thoughts and Behaviors—Adult. Similarly, gates for 'Somatic Symptoms' were removed, enabling direct progression to LEVEL 2—Somatic Symptom—Adult.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>Clinical Alerts</b></p>
<p>For HBCD, this measure was modified to alert study staff if responses to the APA suicide question ('Thoughts of actually hurting yourself?') or APA depression question (ranging from 'I felt worthless' to 'I felt that nothing could cheer me up') exceed thresholds of 0 and 32, respectively.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>Response Option Changes</b></p>
<p>'Refuse to answer' option was added to all questions (note that this does not affect scoring as skipped questions are ignored).</p> 
</div>
</p>

### DSM5 PTSD/Acute Stress Short Scale
The HBCD Severity of Posttraumatic/Acute Stress Symptoms measure was developed to capture maternal PTSD and acute stress symptoms, assessing the severity of PTSD and acute stress disorder following a traumatic event (for individuals aged 18 and older). It combines National Stressful Events Survey items 1-9 from the PTSD Short Scale ([NSESSS-PTSD](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Posttraumatic-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf)) and item 3 from the Acute Stress Disorder Short Scale ([NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Acute-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf)) into a single assessment for the HBCD study, with the addition of a 'refuse to answer' response option (but not 'don’t know'). Future publications should note that this measure combines NSESSS-PTSD and NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder.

Scores on these scales assess trauma-related stress symptoms and do not differentiate between PTSD and Acute Stress Disorder. Researchers should review individual items to determine the most relevant scale to their research. Total raw scores are computed as the sum of scores from questions 1-9 for PTSD and questions 1-3 & 7-10 for Acute Stress.

### EPDS
The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (<a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/Postnatal%20Depression%20Scale.pdf">EPDS</a>), a sensitive, 10-item screening tool for prenatal and postpartum depression symptoms, was selected to capture symptoms of maternal depression due to its ease of administration and widely accepted use. For HBCD, the response option 'refuse to answer' was added to all questions. Note that this does not impact scoring as questions answered with ‘refuse to answer’ are skipped (see EPDS scoring procedure [here](https://med.stanford.edu/content/dam/sm/ppc/documents/DBP/EDPS_text_added.pdf)). In addition, scores for EPDS suicide (score>1) or depression (overall score>11) triggered clinical alerts for study staff.
