## Implementation & Data Collection
Surveys were translated to Spanish for HBCD by [BURG Translations](https://burgtranslations.com/our-services/). All are child-unspecific and were self-administered either in-person or remote with the exception of FAM MH, which was only self-administered in-person. Additional information is as follows:

## Quality Control
For all mental health instruments, response distributions were reviewed for outliers and no common issues were identified. No potential issues were flagged by subject matter experts.

## Instrument Details
### Personal & Family Psychiatric History 
The HBCD FAM MH assesses self-reported diagnoses and mental health conditions of the biological mother, biological father, and biological maternal and paternal grandmother and grandfather. It was created from combining and modifying items from the [Family History Assessment Module (FHAM)](https://arc.psych.wisc.edu/self-report/family-history-assessment-module-fham/) and the [All of Us Personal and Family Health History](https://www.researchallofus.org/wp-content/themes/research-hub-wordpress-theme/media/2023/PaFHH_Survey_English.pdf). The HBCD FAM MH includes (1) FHAM items on alcohol use [alc], drug use [drug], depression [dep], mania [man], and Schizophrenia [sch]; and (2) All of Us mental health outcomes for only biological mother [bm] and biological father [bf]: Alcohol Use Disorder [001], Anxiety disorder or panic disorder [002], Autism Spectrum Disorder [003], Bipolar disorder [004], Depressive disorder [005], Drug or Substance Use Disorder [006], Schizophrenia [007], and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) [008], excluding questions about age of diagnosis, treatment, and medications. Future publications should note that this measure is a combination of these and that this is not a scored scale, but simply descriptive for family psychiatric history.

<p style="margin-bottom: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px; border-bottom: 1px solid #6b6b6b66;"><strong>Consideration of Mental Health Symptoms Experienced During Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>Concurrence of psychiatric symptoms and substance use is well-recognized during pregnancy (Massey et al., 2011, 2012). Phenotypic risk in birthing parents may influence neurodevelopmental outcomes via prenatal and postnatal influences other than direct exposures alone (Estabrook et al., 2016, Massey et al., 2016, Massey et al., 2018). These influences may confound exposure-related neuroimaging and neurodevelopmental findings, and also represent malleable targets for prevention and early intervention. Thus, consideration of mental health symptoms experienced by birthing parents as covariates is strongly encouraged when possible to address these confounds.</p> 
</div>
</p>

The DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 and Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure (APA 1/2) was adapted for HBCD by combining the following measures: the [DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure—Adult](https://www.psychiatry.org/getmedia/e0b4b299-95b3-407b-b8c2-caa871ca218d/APA-DSM5TR-Level1MeasureAdult.pdf) and the [DSM-5 Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/educational-resources/assessment-measures):

![](images/DSM-5Level2Cross-CuttingSymptomMeasures.png)

**Level 1** includes 1-2 questions for each of eleven mental health domains, with scores calculated for depression, anger, mania, anxiety, somatic symptoms, suicidal ideation, psychosis, sleep disturbance, memory, repetitive behaviors, and dissociation. Note that Level 1 items for personality functioning and substance use were excluded. See Level 1 scoring procedures [here](https://www.psychiatry.org/getmedia/e0b4b299-95b3-407b-b8c2-caa871ca218d/APA-DSM5TR-Level1MeasureAdult.pdf). If symptoms are reported in Level 1, participants are subsequently administered the corresponding Level 2 symptom measure associated with each mental health domain, including anger, anxiety, depression, mania, somatic symptoms, repetitive thoughts, and sleep problems.

**Level 2** measures include all [Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/educational-resources/assessment-measures) with the exception of Substance Abuse. The Level 2 measures for Depression and Sleep Disturbance were replaced with the **PROMIS Short Forms v1.0** [Depression 8a questionnaire](https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/toolkit_content/supplemental_info/psychiatric/measures/07_Depressed_Mood.doc) and [Sleep Disturbance 8a](https://heal.nih.gov/files/CDEs/2024-07/promis-sleep-disturbance-8a-crf.pdf). Documentation for each measure and its scoring can be found [here](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/educational-resources/assessment-measures). PROMIS scoring procedures for Depression can be found [here](https://www.healthmeasures.net/images/PROMIS/manuals/Scoring_Manual_Only/PROMIS_Depression_Scoring_Manual_05Dec2023.pdf) and for Sleep Disturbance can be found [here](https://www.healthmeasures.net/images/PROMIS/manuals/Scoring_Manual_Only/PROMIS_Sleep_Scoring_Manual.pdf).

Finally, the HBCD measure also integrates the [Personality Inventory for DSM-5 Brief](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_The-Personality-Inventory-For-DSM-5-Brief-Form-Adult.pdf), which assesses five personality trait domains including negative affect, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition, and psychoticism. Scoring for the Personality Inventory can be found [here](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_The-Personality-Inventory-For-DSM-5-Brief-Form-Adult.pdf).

Additional modifications are described below. Future publications should be sure to acknowledge the removal of Level 1 and 2 substance use and the gating mechanisms for somatic symptoms and personality inventory:

<div class="collapsible-content">
<br>
<p style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>Excluded Questions and Gating</b></p>
<p>Slight modifications were made due to the use of other measures and the study population. Specifically, the Level 1 questions for substance use and personality functioning were not included. Also, all participants answer the level 1 questions on depression and somatic symptoms but proceed to level 2 questions irrespective of answers; all participants proceed automatically to the level 2 measure for personality inventory.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>Clinical Alerts</b></p>
<p>For HBCD, this measure was modified to alert study staff if responses to the Level 1 APA self-harm question ('Thoughts of actually hurting yourself?') or Level 2 APA depression questionnaire (items from 'I felt worthless' to 'I felt that nothing could cheer me up') exceed thresholds of 0 and 32, respectively.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>Response Option Changes</b></p>
<p>For HBCD, the response option ‘Decline to answer’ was added to all questions. The response option ‘Don’t know’ was also included at the beginning of data collection, but was subsequently removed. Note that this does not impact scoring as questions answered with ‘Decline to answer’ or ‘Don’t know’ are skipped and marked as missing.</p> 

<p>Note that in early data releases, total scores are not calculated for Level 2 measures. Users are encouraged to score individual scales themselves according to the scoring procedures linked above.</p>

The HBCD Severity of Posttraumatic/Acute Stress Symptoms measure was developed to assess the severity of PTSD and acute stress symptoms following a traumatic event (for individuals aged 18 and older). It combines items from two surveys from the National Stressful Events Surveys: items 1-9 from the PTSD Short Scale ([NSESSS-PTSD](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Posttraumatic-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf)) and item 3 from the Acute Stress Disorder Short Scale ([NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Acute-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf)) into a single 10-item assessment for the HBCD study.  Responses are scored 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 and responses to items are summed for a total score. For HBCD, the response option ‘Decline to answer’ was added to all questions. The response option ‘Don’t know’ was also included at the beginning of data collection, but was subsequently removed. Future publications should note that this measure combines NSESSS-PTSD and NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder.

Scores on these scales assess trauma-related stress symptoms and do not differentiate between PTSD and Acute Stress Disorder. Researchers should review individual items on each scale to determine the most relevant scale to their research. Individual total scores are provided for NSESSS-PTSD and NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder, and are computed as the sum of scores from questions 1-9 for PTSD and questions 1-3 & 7-10 for Acute Stress. Note: If 3 or more items are left unanswered, the total score on the scale is not calculated. If 1 or 2 items are left unanswered, a prorated score is calculated by summing the scores of items that were answered to get a partial raw score, multiplying the partial raw score by the total number of items (i.e., 9 on NSESSS-PTSD and 7 on NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder), and dividing the value by the number of items that were actually answered, rounded to the nearest whole number.


**Questionnaire prompt/instructions:**    
*People sometimes have problems after extremely stressful events or experiences. How much have you been bothered during the PAST SEVEN (7) DAYS by each of the following problems that occurred or became worse after an extremely stressful event/experience?*


### EPDS

The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (<a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/Postnatal%20Depression%20Scale.pdf">EPDS</a>), a sensitive, 10-item screening tool for prenatal and postpartum depression symptoms, was selected to capture symptoms of prenatal and postnatal depression due to its ease of administration and widely accepted use. Responses are scored 0, 1, 2, or 3, and responses to items are summed for a total score. Note that items 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are reverse scored (i.e., 3, 2, 1, 0). For HBCD, the response option ‘Decline to answer’ was added to all questions. The response option ‘Don’t know’ was also included at the beginning of data collection, but was subsequently removed. Note that this does not impact scoring as questions answered with ‘Decline to answer’ or ‘Don’t know’ are skipped and marked as missing. Note that total scores are not prorated or left missing for missing items and data users should determine how best to address missing data. In addition, scores for EPDS self-harm (score>1) and depression (total score>11) triggered clinical alerts for study staff.

**Questionnaire prompt/instructions:**     
*Since you are either pregnant or have recently had a baby, we want to know how you feel. MARK the answer that comes closest to how you have felt IN THE PAST 7 DAYS-not just how you feel today.*

*In the past 7 days…*
