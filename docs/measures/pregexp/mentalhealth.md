**Summary**     
This is a highly sensitive screening tool for use in community samples. It combines two measures: the [DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure—Adult](https://www.psychiatry.org/getmedia/e0b4b299-95b3-407b-b8c2-caa871ca218d/APA-DSM5TR-Level1MeasureAdult.pdf) and the DSM-5 Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures:

The mental health screening instrument has two levels. Level 1 includes one to two questions for each of thirteen mental health conditions. When symptoms were reported for Level 1, the participant answered several subsequent questions, which asked about additional symptoms associated with each mental health condition, including anger, anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms, and sleep problems. Slight modifications were made due to the use of other measures and the study population. Specifically, the level 1 questions for personality functioning and substance use were not included; participants proceed automatically to level 2 measures. In addition, all participants answer the level 1 questions on depression but proceed to level 2 questions irrespective of answers.

## HBCD Modifications
<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Global Measure Changes</u></b></p>
<ul>
The APA 1/2 measure was modified in the following ways:
    <ul>
      <li>Removed Level 1 gates from ‘personality functioning’ to go straight to Level 2 LEVEL 2—Repetitive Thoughts and Behaviors—Adult (adapted from the Florida Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory [FOCI] Severity Scale [Part B])</li>
      <li>Removed gates from ‘Somatic symptoms’ to go straight to ‘LEVEL 2—Somatic Symptom—Adult (Patient Health Questionnaire 15 Somatic Symptom Severity [PHQ-15])’</li>
      <li>Removed ‘substance use’ from Level 1-2 as its queried in other measures</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
To acknowledged these changes in future publications: removal of Level 1-2 substance use (section XIII) as well as gates for sections V (somatic) and XII (personality) should be noted.

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Answer/Response Option Changes</u></b></p>
  The option ‘refuse to answer’ was added to all questions. Note that this does not impact scoring (questions answered with ‘refuse to answer’ are skipped).

## Quality Control & Known Issues 
Response distributions were reviewed for outliers and no common issues were identified. No potential issues were flagged by subject matter experts.

## Additional Information
When symptoms were reported for Level 1, the participant answered several subsequent questions, which asked about additional symptoms associated with each mental health condition, including anger, anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms, and sleep problems. Slight modifications were made due to the use of other measures and the study population. Specifically, the level 1 questions for personality functioning and substance use were not included; participants proceed automatically to level 2 measures. In addition, all participants answer the level 1 questions on depression but proceed to level 2 questions irrespective of answers.

Note: The following scores triggered an alert for study staff:   

 * APA suicide ('Thoughts of actually hurting yourself?'), score greater than 0
 * APA depression (from 'I felt worthless' to 'I felt that nothing could cheer me up'), raw score greater than 32
