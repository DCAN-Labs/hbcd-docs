## APA 1/2
### Overview
**Full Name**: DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 and Level 2 (version 8a) Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure—Adult   
**Acronym/Brief Name**: APA 1/2  
**Construct**: Mental health   
**Description**: This was a created to capture maternal mental health  
**Summary**: This is a highly sensitive screening tool for use in community samples. This mental health screening instrument has two levels. Level 1 includes one to two questions for each of thirteen mental health conditions. When symptoms were reported for Level 1, the participant answered several subsequent questions, which asked about additional symptoms associated with each mental health condition, including anger, anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms, and sleep problems. Slight modifications were made due to the use of other measures and the study population. Specifically, the level 1 questions for personality functioning and substance use were not included; participants proceed automatically to level 2 measures. In addition, all participants answer the level 1 questions on depression but proceed to level 2 questions irrespective of answers.

**Description**: This measure was created to capture maternal PTSD and acute stress symptoms  
**Summary**: The Severity of Posttraumatic/Acute Stress Symptoms is a measure that assesses the severity of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder in individuals ages 18 and older following an extremely stressful event or experience. Items 1-9 from the National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scale (NSESSS—PTSD) and Item 3 from the National Stressful Events Survey Acute Stress Disorder Short Scale (NSESSS—Acute Stress Disorder) were combined into a single assessment for the HBCD study to capture the severity of maternal posttraumatic/acute stress symptoms.

### Implementation 
**Method of Administration**: self-administered in person or remote
**REDCap Form Name**: DSD5 Severity Acute Stress or PTSD 
**Pilot Data Dictionary**:   
**Spanish Translation**: Created  
**Child Specific/Unspecific Form**: Unspecific 
**Respondent:** pregnant person/person who gave birth/primary caregiver

### Data Collection
**Visits Administered and corresponding age range of administration**:  V1, V2, V3
**Estimated length of time for completion**: 3 minutes

### Quality Control (QC) 
**QC Procedures**: Distributions for answers  
**Common Issues Identified**: None

This measure is a combination of two measures: the Severity of Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms—Adult* National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scale (NSESSS-PTSD) (questions 1-9) [**https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Posttraumatic-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf**](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Posttraumatic-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf)

And the Severity of Acute Stress Symptoms—Adult* National Stressful Events Survey Acute Stress Disorder Short Scale (NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder) (question 3) [**https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Acute-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf**](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Acute-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf)

The NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder is a 7-item scale, 6 of which are the same questions from the PTSD short scale, with one additional unique question. 

Please note that scores on these scales will not differentiate between symptoms of PTSD versus Acute Stress Disorder, but rather, both assess for trauma-related stress symptoms, and researchers should review the individual items to determine which scale best meets their interest.

**Thus, the scales are as follows:**

| Total Raw Score Acute Stress (Total of Questions 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10) |
| :---- |
| Total Raw Score PTSD (Total of Questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) |
