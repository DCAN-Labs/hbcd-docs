<p>When writing about mental health symptoms or diagnoses, it is important to use person-centered language. One exception to this is in the area of autism, where there is ongoing dialogue within the affected community about preferred language. It is important to take guidance from those with lived experiences and professional stakeholders when considering any language. Please see the following resources:</p>

</ul>

<p>Many mental health diagnoses and experiences with mental health care can be influenced by cultural and structural factors that could impact the interpretation of items (symptoms), as well as influenced by previous diagnoses assigned by providers outside the ABCD Study. These cultural and structural factors should be acknowledged, as appropriate.</p>

<p>We recommend statistically examining measurement invariance in mental health measures, considering whether scales and individual items function similarly across demographic groups, and carefully considering the use of measures when bias is demonstrated. It is important for researchers to explicitly acknowledge: (1) potential sources of bias, (2) issues with the measure given evidence of measurement invariance, and/or (3) interpretation limitations that may stem from the use of a given measure.</p>

<p>We recommend following these recommendations for the responsible use and communication of race and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01608-4">ethnicity</a>.</p>

## Personal & Family Psychiatric History 
This measure was created from combining and modifying the [Family History Assessment Module (FHAM)](https://arc.psych.wisc.edu/self-report/family-history-assessment-module-fham/) and the [All of Us Personal and Family Health History](https://www.researchallofus.org/wp-content/themes/research-hub-wordpress-theme/media/2023/PaFHH_Survey_English.pdf). It assesses self-reported diagnoses and mental health conditions of the biologic mother, father, maternal parents and paternal parents. 

### HBCD Modifications
For future publications, authors should note that this measure, as noted in the prior section, is a combination of FHAM and All of Us. It is also not a scored scale, but simply descriptive for family history.

<p style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>Instruction/Assessment Item Modifications</b></p>
From FHAM, only alcohol-schizophrenia were selected; items for Antisocial Personality Disorder and Undifferentiated Psychiatric Disorder were not included. Additionally, ‘trouble with law’ and ‘nervous breakdown’ were excluded.
From All of Us, we were only interested in a few mental health outcomes (AUD, anxiety, ASD, BPD, depression, SUD, schizophrenia and ADHD) and were not interested in age of diagnosis or medications to treat.

<p style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>Answer/Response Option Changes</b></p>
For FHAM response options (originally including 'parents', 'grandparents', 'siblings', 'aunts', 'uncles', and 'cousins') were modified to include only biological mom, dad and grandparents. For All of Us, response options (originally 'mom', 'dad', 'sibling', 'daughter', 'son', and 'grandparent') were modified to include only biological mom and dad.

## APA 1/2 Mental Health
This is a highly sensitive screening tool for use in community samples. It combines two measures: the [DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure—Adult](https://www.psychiatry.org/getmedia/e0b4b299-95b3-407b-b8c2-caa871ca218d/APA-DSM5TR-Level1MeasureAdult.pdf) and the DSM-5 Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures:

![](images/DSM-5Level2Cross-CuttingSymptomMeasures.png)

The mental health screening instrument has two levels. Level 1 includes one to two questions for each of thirteen mental health conditions. When symptoms were reported for Level 1, the participant answered several subsequent questions pertaining to additional symptoms associated with each mental health condition, including anger, anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms, and sleep problems. Slight modifications were made due to the use of other measures and the study population (see [HBCD Modifications](#hbcd-modifications) for details). Alerts for study staff were triggered when APA suicide ('Thoughts of actually hurting yourself?') and/or APA depression (from 'I felt worthless' to 'I felt that nothing could cheer me up') were scored greater than 0 and 32, respectively.

    </ul>
</div>
</p>

### HBCD Modifications
The APA 1/2 measure was modified to account for the use of other measures and the study population. Level 1 questions for personality functioning and substance use (as this is queried in other measures) were removed to proceed automatically to LEVEL 2—Repetitive Thoughts and Behaviors—Adult (adapted from the Florida Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory [FOCI] Severity Scale [Part B]). All participants answer the level 1 questions on depression, but proceed to level 2 questions irrespective of answers. Gates were also removed from ‘Somatic symptoms’ to go straight to ‘LEVEL 2—Somatic Symptom—Adult (Patient Health Questionnaire 15 Somatic Symptom Severity [PHQ-15]).’

In addition, the option ‘refuse to answer’ was added to all questions. Note that this does not impact scoring (questions answered with ‘refuse to answer’ are skipped). To acknowledged these changes in future publications: removal of Level 1-2 substance use (section XIII) as well as gates for sections V (somatic) and XII (personality) should be noted.

## DSM5 PTSD/Acute Stress Short Scale
This measure was created to capture maternal PTSD and acute stress symptoms. The Severity of Posttraumatic/Acute Stress Symptoms is a measure that assesses the severity of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder in individuals ages 18 and older following an extremely stressful event or experience. It combines items 1-9 from the National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scale ([NSESSS-PTSD](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Posttraumatic-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf) and Item 3 from the National Stressful Events Survey Acute Stress Disorder Short Scale ([NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Acute-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf)) into a single assessment for the HBCD study. 

Note that scores on these scales do not differentiate between symptoms of PTSD versus Acute Stress Disorder, but rather assess for trauma-related stress symptoms. As such, researchers should review the individual items to determine which scale best meets their interest. Total raw scores for each scale are computed as follows:

- Total Raw Score Acute Stress: sum of scores from questions 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, and 10
- Total Raw Score PTSD: sum of scores from questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9

### HBCD Modifications
In future publications, authors should note that this measure is a combination of NSESSS-PTSD and NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder as described above. The only additional modification was that we added ‘refuse to answer’, but not ‘don’t know,’ to the response options. Scoring has always allowed skips when done on paper, and the authors are not specific for how to deal with that.


## The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale
<ul>
The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (<a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/Postnatal%20Depression%20Scale.pdf">EPDS</a>), a sensitive, 10-item screening tool for prenatal and postpartum depression symptoms, was selected to capture symptoms of maternal depression due to its ease of administration and widely accepted use. The EPDS scoring procedure is described <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/content/dam/sm/ppc/documents/DBP/EDPS_text_added.pdf">here</a>. The following scores on the EPDS triggered a clinical alert for study staff:
    <li>EPDS suicide ('The thought of harming myself has occurred to me'), score greater than 1</li>
    <li>EPDS depression, overall score greater than 11</li>
</ul>

### HBCD Modifications
The option ‘refuse to answer’ was added to all questions. Note that this does not impact scoring (questions answered with ‘refuse to answer’ are skipped).
