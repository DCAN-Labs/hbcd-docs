**Child Specific/Unspecific Form**: Unspecific  
**Respondent:** pregnant person     
**Visits**: V1 (pregnancy)      
**Estimated length of time for completion**: 3 minutes

### Quality Control & Known Issues
**QC Procedures**: Distributions for answers  
**Common Issues Identified**: None      
**Potential Issues Flagged by Subject Matter Experts**: Illnesses are captured either from ICD codes (from BioPortal ICD) or symptom codes (from World Health Organization), which were at times difficult for the participant to name or the RA to correctly find in the ICD or symptom database.

**Respondent:** pregnant person     
**Visits**:  V1 pregnancy visit     
**Estimated length of time for completion**: 5 minutes

### Quality Control & Known Issues
**QC Procedures**: Distributions for answers  
**Common Issues Identified**: None      
**Potential Issues Flagged by Subject Matter Experts**: Reasons for ER visit or hospitalization are captured from ICD codes (from BioPortal ICD), which were at times difficult for the participant to name or the RA to correctly find in the ICD database. This was particularly apparent for use of the ER for normal care (no diagnosis) or false alarms (e.g. thought water broke but it did not), resulting in the use of ‘don’t know.’

**REDCap Form Name**: `Meds`   
**Spanish Translation**: Created  
**Child Specific/Unspecific Form**: Unspecific  
**Respondent:** pregnant person     
**Visits**:  V1 (pregnancy)     
**Estimated length of time for completion**: 5 minutes

### Quality Control & Known Issues
**QC Procedures**: Distributions for answers  
**Common Issues Identified**: None      
**Potential Issues Flagged by Subject Matter Experts**: Medication was queried from the RxNORM database. Reasons for medication use are captured from ICD codes (from BioPortal ICD), which were at times difficult for the participant to name or the RA to correctly find in the ICD database. This was apparent with aspirin used for preeclampsia, as there was not an option for coding preventive use. Aspirin was specifically moved to the prenatal vitamin section a few months into the study. Additionally, medications used PRN were difficult for the participant to report. Finally, although not asked, some medications were coded with the dose in the database, although this was not asked and should not be used.
