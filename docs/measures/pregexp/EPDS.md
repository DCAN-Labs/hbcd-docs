# The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale
<ul>
The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (<a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/Postnatal%20Depression%20Scale.pdf">EPDS</a>), a sensitive, 10-item screening tool for prenatal and postpartum depression symptoms, was selected to capture symptoms of maternal depression due to its ease of administration and widely accepted use. The EPDS scoring procedure is described <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/content/dam/sm/ppc/documents/DBP/EDPS_text_added.pdf">here</a>. The following scores on the EPDS triggered a clinical alert for study staff:
    <li>EPDS suicide ('The thought of harming myself has occurred to me'), score greater than 1</li>
    <li>EPDS depression, overall score greater than 11</li>
</ul>

## HBCD Modifications
The option ‘refuse to answer’ was added to all questions. Note that this does not impact scoring (questions answered with ‘refuse to answer’ are skipped). 

## Quality Control & Known Issues 
Response distributions were reviewed for outliers and no common issues were identified. No potential issues were flagged by subject matter experts.
