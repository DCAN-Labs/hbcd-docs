## Quality Control & Known Issues
For all measures, QC procedures involved review of response distributions (crossed with TLFB for Assist V1/V2 and vice versa) for outlier detection. One common issue noted was that reported substances used on the TLFB were not always noted on the Assist V1/V2, which triggered a query to the site to correct it. 

Subject matter experts note that it was difficult for some participants to self-report the typical size of a single drink (in oz) to capture ‘standard drinks’ of alcohol for Assist. Some reports are therefore outside expected range. In addition, occasions of substance use is difficult to report for substances such as electronic cigarette devices, also resulting in outliers. Sites were queried on outliers, but participants were not always able to be re-contacted. 

For the TLFB, note that it samples only specific weeks before (Weeks 1-2) and during (Weeks 3-9) pregnancy. As a result, substance use could be reported during pregnancy, but may not appear in the TLFB if it falls outside these sampled weeks. Likewise, a positive biospecimen could lack corresponding TLFB data for the same reason. This sampling method — covering periods before, early, mid, and late pregnancy — aims to reduce participant burden (avoiding a full 40-week TLFB) while capturing key pregnancy phases when behaviors tend to shift (i.e. before and after pregnancy recognition and late pregnancy). 

The TLFB data should be combined with the biospecimen and Assist data. One could also create trajectories of use from the TLFB with assumptions by using data on early pregnancy (weeks 3-6) carried forward until stated pregnancy recognition (V1 Health), then using enrollment (week 7) information and carrying that forward until late pregnancy (weeks 8-9). 

## Instrument Details
### Assist V1/V2/V3
The Assist V1, V2, and V3 measures were created from combining the Family History Assessment Module (FHAM) and the All of Us Personal and Family Health History, which was then modified from the [NIDA Quick Screen (Modified Assist)](https://nida.nih.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/nmassist.pdf). The original quick screen was scored; however, our version is not scored. To acknowledged these changes in future publications, authors can note that questions were motivated from the NIDA Modified Assist.

The NIDA quick screen tool (*have you used alcohol, tobacco, prescription drugs, or illegal drugs in the last year*) was removed and replaced by questions to assess more details regarding substances used and the timeline of use before and during pregnancy:

<div class="notification-collapsible-content">

<u>V1: Replaced with following to assess lifetime use</u>
	<li>Have you EVER been concerned about your use of this substance or worried it was problematic use?</li>
	<li>Has a friend, relative, or anyone else EVER expressed concern about your use of this substance</li>
	<li>Have you EVER tried and failed to control, cut down, or stop using this substance?</li>
	<li>Have you EVER sought or received treatment related to your use of this substance by a medical provider, spiritual leader, community mutual help group (like AA or SMART Recovery), counselors, or in other settings</li>
	<li>Have you EVER been clinically diagnosed with abuse, dependence, or a substance use disorder related to your use of this substance</li>
	<li>Have you EVER taken (prescribed or otherwise) medication(s) as treatment for a problem substance</li>

<u>V3: Replaced with following to assess impact of substance use after pregnancy:</u>
	<li>DURING THE PAST THREE MONTHS, has your use of this substance led to physical or mental health, social,or financial problems?</li>

    </ul>
</div>
</p>

The list of substances was also greatly expanded for HBCD. For each substance, participants indicated their frequency of use with options: 0 (Never), 1 (Once or Twice), 2 (Monthly), 3 (Weekly), or 4 (Daily or Almost Daily). For substances reported as used, participants were asked about modes of use, typical quantities of consumption for alcohol and opiods (if applicable), and disordered or problematic use.

Finally, additional screening for substance use (within three months before or during pregnancy) was implemented for Assist V1 to trigger the Time Line Follow Back (TLFB). The additional questions ask which substances (from the list above) the person used for any reason (1) in the three months before becoming pregnant and (2) during pregnancy. For substances used, respondants were then asked to specify the specific substance type as well (e.g. type of alcohol, cannabinoid, stimulant, tobacco, hallucinogen, and/or opioid)


### TLFB
The [original Timline Follow Back](https://cde.nida.nih.gov/sites/nida_cde/files/TimeLineFollowBack_2014Mar24.pdf) is designed to cover the last 7 days from when the survey is administered. The [HBCD TLFB](https://cde.nida.nih.gov/sites/nida_cde/files/TimeLineFollowBack_2014Mar24.pdf), triggered by Assist responses, was adapted to instead record maternal substance use before and during pregnancy. Participants reported use during 9 weeks in total for each product type (e.g., edible cannabis) reported on the ASSIST. For V1, this includes: pre-pregnancy use (Weeks 1-2: four weeks to two weeks before LMP), early pregnancy use (Weeks 3-6: two to six weeks after LMP), and current use (Week 7: the week prior to V1). The TLFB was repeated at V2 to capture substance use during the last two full weeks of gestation (Weeks 8-9). Daily usage frequency was recorded for all products except for cigarettes/cigarillos (count per day) and alcohol (single servings per day).
