## HBCD Modifications
<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Global Measure Changes</u></b></p>
For future publications, authors should note that this measure is a combination of FHAM and All of Us, as described above, but this is not a scored scale; its simply descriptive for family history.

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Instruction/Assessment Item Modifications</u></b></p>
- Only selected alcohol-schizophrenia from FHAM; dropped ‘trouble with law’ and ‘nervous breakdown’.
- From All of Us, we were only interested in a few mental health outcomes (AUD, anxiety, ASD, BPD, depression, SUD, schizophrenia and ADHD). Also, we were not interested in age of diagnosis or medications to treat.

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Answer/Response Option Changes</u></b></p>
- FHAM: response options (*originally parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, uncles, and cousins*) modified to include only biological mom, dad and grandparents 
- All of Us: response options (*originally mom, dad, sibling, daughter, son, and grandparent*) modified to include only biological mom and dad

## Quality Control & Known Issues
Response distributions were reviewed for outliers and no common issues were identified. No potential issues were flagged by subject matter experts.
