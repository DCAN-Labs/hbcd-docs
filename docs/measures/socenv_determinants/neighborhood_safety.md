This measure is a three-item questionnaire to assess the respondent’s perceptions about safety, violence, and crime in their neighborhoods.

The respondent’s perception of their neighborhood may also be used alongside geocoded measures of neighborhood crime statistics to help understand an individuals experience within a neighborhood.
