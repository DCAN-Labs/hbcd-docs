    <i>Many of these questions are about your culture. In this country, people come from a lot of different cultures. There are many words to describe these cultures, such as the culture of your family, a country where you or your family members were born, an ethnicity, or a religion. We refer to these below as your "family culture." While we ALL live in America, when we refer to "American" culture in the following items, we mean cultural practices or traditions that are NOT part of your family's ethnic, religious, or other cultural practices, but that are practiced often as part of "American" culture.</i>
    <br>
    <i>Please select all that apply. If you do not identify with a culture other than American, select "none". If your family culture is not listed, select "None of these apply/My family culture is not listed".</i>
  </ul>

## Experiences with Police
<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Assessment Item & Response Modifications</u></b></p>
All questions related to close friends or family members were removed as part of protocol reduction efforts. The response option "Don't Know" was additionally included as it was missing from the original options.

## Composite Abuse Scale Revised - Short Form
<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Global Measure Changes</u></b></p>
Language was altered to use gender-neutral terms (e.g "a current of former husband, partner or boyfriend/girlfriend" revised to "spouse, partner, significant other"). Investigators should consider noting the use of gender-neutral terminology in the definition of intimate partner in the methods section of future publications. 

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Scoring Changes</u></b></p>
The original scoring procedure is to compute the mean of the frequency of abuse experience responses and multiply by 15 when there are responses for at least 11 items. For HBCD, “Don’t know” and “Decline to answer” were added as response options and during scoring are counted as missing or no response. Otherwise, no change was made to the scoring procedure.
