# Infant Sensor Questionnaire
**Full Name**: Daily survey about infant heart rate sensor and infant leg movement sensors.   
**Acronym/Brief Name**: Infant Sensor Questionnaire  
**Construct**: motor behavior, physical activity, sleep   
   
The questionnaire was sent once per day for 3 days while the infant was wearing the heart rate sensor and infant leg movement sensors to obtain information about context of the sensor recordings. Please see [Pini et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2024.101446) for a full description of this measure. Briefly, the Infant Sensor Questionnaire survey, developed by the working group, was automatically sent to primary caregivers after 24, 48, and 72 hours of sensor recording. The survey covered the preceding 24-hour period, asking if the sensors were worn for most of the time and gathering information about the infant's daily activities (e.g. whether the period was typical for the infant; estimates of how much they napped and slept; time spent in car seat, swing, or other restraining device; time spent in a moving car, stroller, or being carried; and whether their legs were swaddled during naps and sleep).

### Quality Control & Known Issues 
A small percentage of surveys (due to the procedure being manual) were randomly spot-checked on a weekly basis to confirm presence of responses. When no responses were received, RAs were contacted to confirm whether the surveys had been sent to participants as intended. The most common cause of missing responses was caregiver non-response, and less commonly due to human error (preferred contact/contact method not selected by RA) or technological malfunction. No issues were flagged for this measure by subject matter experts.
