# HBCD Changes for Additional Measures

## ScreenQ
<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Global Measure Changes</u></b></p>
When the child is mentioned, pronouns were changed from he/she to “the child” for gender neutrality.

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Scoring Changes</u></b></p>
The responses “don’t know” and "decline to answer" were added as options where appropriate, which are considered missing data for scoring. The ScreenQ should not include a summative score if there are missing data, therefore any questionnaire including those answers should not have a summative score calculated and independent researchers can decide how they deal with missingness.
