### HBCD Modifications
When the child is mentioned, pronouns were changed from he/she to “the child.” The response option "don't know" was also added to the survey, which does not impact scoring because the screen is not scored in HBCD. Researchers should be aware that the validated measure uses “yes” “no” answers and does not speak to missing data.

**Acronym/Brief Name**: growth    
**Construct**: Growth       
Growth is a standard direct measure of child height or length (in cm), weight (in kg), head circumference (cm). In older children, will also include abdominal circumference (cm).
