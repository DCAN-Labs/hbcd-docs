# Demographics

## Overview
**Full Name**: HBCD Demographics V01  
**Acronym/Brief Name**: Demographics  
**Construct**: Basic social characteristics related to the birthing parent, the other biological parent, and their household.  
**Description**: The HBCD Study demographics survey is designed to gather comprehensive information on socioeconomic status and various demographic factors. Its primary purpose is to capture data on race, ethnicity, nativity, income, education, and occupation, as well as gender identity, sexual orientation, relationship status, primary residence, and household composition of the parent carrying the child, and some basic information on the other biological parent. 
From [Cioffredi et al, *Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience,* 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929324000902) (p. 2-4): 

> The HBCD Demographics survey was designed to collect social and economic information including race, ethnicity, nativity, income, maternal education, and occupation, as well as to characterize gender identity, sexual orientation, relationship status, primary residence, and household composition. The household composition matrix asks for details on all household members including age, gender, relationship to the child, relationship to the primary caregiver, and time spent caring for the child. Participants and families who endorse no primary residence, or that they are living in a shelter or treatment facility, are not asked to complete the household matrix. The survey includes a limited set of questions on the child’s “other biological parent” (i.e., race, ethnicity, nativity, education, occupation), provided the respondent endorsed an item indicating that they could answer this set of questions. Although there are no direct questions about the primary caregiver’s spouse/partner in the demographics, details of this relationship can be found within the household composition roster. The questions on Occupation ask for detailed information about exposures to environmental toxicants.    
> Careful consideration was given to ensure that questions were inclusive of diverse populations and could capture a wide range of family structures and living situations that may impact child health outcomes. As a result, survey elements available within the PhenX Toolkit and other large-scale NIH studies were reviewed and modified by the Social and Environmental Determinants working group and the HBCD Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Committee to reduce bias and correct for embedded assumptions of heteronormative nuclear-family structures (see **Table** with sources, below). Future demographics surveys will repeat survey elements from Visit 4 for both the primary caregiver and the child.

**Summary**: Demographic information is crucial for understanding the child’s environment and identifying how social, structural, and economic factors influence development over time in a longitudinal study of child development. By capturing detailed information, the Demographics survey provides key information on the child’s context. Repeating these measures allows researchers to track changes and study these changes in relation to development.

## Implementation Details
**Method of Administration**: RA administered in person     
**REDCap Form Name**: N/A  
**Pilot Data Dictionary**:   
**Spanish Translation**:   
**Child Specific/Unspecific Form**: Child Unspecific  
**Respondent:** adult participant

## Data Collection
**Visits Administered and corresponding age range of administration**: V1: prenatal     
**Estimated length of time for completion**: 10 minutes

## Quality Control (QC)
**QC Procedures**: QC procedures included monitoring the data dashboard for variable missingness and data consistency.<br>
**Common Issues Identified**: High missing on income (although in line with expectations)

## Potential Issues Flagged by Subject Matter Experts
 We learned through RA reports that some participants reported challenges in answering certain questions, such as those related to race and ethnicity (e.g., options did not capture identity) and occupation (i.e., imperfect option for job type and number of hours).
