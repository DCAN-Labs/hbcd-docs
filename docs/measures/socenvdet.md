## Implementation & Data Collection
With the exception of PROMIS, all surveys, filled out by the parent, are child-unspecific. Surveys were translated to Spanish for HBCD by [BURG Translations](https://burgtranslations.com/our-services/). Additional information is as follows:

## Quality Control & Known Issues
For the majority of instruments, the data dashboard was monitored for variable missingness, possible coding errors, scoring verification when needed, and data consistency - Neighborhood Safety was monitored only for missingness. No potential issues were identified via the QC procedures or flagged by subject matter experts for any survey.

## Instrument Details
### Baby’s First Years
BFY assesses economic stress, financial instability, ability to meet basic needs, and benefits/services received over the past 12 months on a 10 Likert Scale. Selected questions from the [Year 1 protocol](https://www.babysfirstyears.com/_files/ugd/88a466_5a28f2b284e74fa4b61b2c483008416e.docx?dn=BFY_Age%201%20Survey.docx) of the NIH-funded Baby’s First Years study of infant and child development and originated from the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) study. Some slight modifications were made for the HBCD study by removing the Medicaid coverage question asked elsewhere in the study and adding a question asking whether anyone in the family receives free and reduced lunch.

### Discrimination
The [PhenX+ Toolkit Discrimination](https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/protocols/view/210302) measure is a questionnaire to assess perceived discriminatory experiences. Discrimination is an important factor in an individual’s health because it affects access to employment, housing, and education opportunities and can affect self-esteem and cause stress.

<p>For the *Everyday Discrimination Scale* and *Major Experiences of Discrimination*, the Follow-up Question ("What do you think is the main reason for these experiences?") was asked once after both were complete to capture the main reasons for any items marked “a few times a year” (*Everyday Discrimination Scale*) or “yes” (*Major Experiences of Discrimination*). The original logic asked this question at the end of each individual scale.</p>

### eHITS    
The eHITS is a self-administered 5 question Likert scale screener for experiences of psychological aggression, physical assault, sexual coercion, and injury. Originally created for quick administration in a health care setting or emergency department, the eHITS asks individuals to indicate whether their partner has done any of the following over the past 12 months: "physically hurt you", "insulted you", "threatened to harm you", "screamed or cursed at you", or "forced you to have sexual activities."

<p>Various research groups made minor word changes. Sherin and colleagues developed the original instrument, HITS, published in 1998. Chan and colleagues expanded HITS to include a question regarding forced sexual activity <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/102490791001700202">Chan et al. 2010</a>
<p>To acknowledged these changes in future publications, the WG recommends that investigators who analyze data generated by eHITS during HBCD include the exact verbiage of the HBCD-version of the item in the methods section of any reports, presentations, and manuscripts.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0 5px 5px;"><b>Scoring Procedures</b></p>
<p>The eHITS summary score (sum of item ratings) is used clinically as a screening tool for intimate partner violence (IPV) based on a certain threshold. For HBCD, a clinical alert for IPV is triggered when the summary score is greater than 7 and/or the scores for “…physically hurt you?” or “…forced you to engage in sexual activity?” is greater than 0. If a respondent selects “Don’t know” for one or more questions, a clinical alert may not generate for a participant whose correct responses would result in a score sufficient to trigger an alert.</p>

### Neighborhood Safety
This measure is a three-item questionnaire to assess the respondent’s perceptions about safety, violence, and crime in their neighborhoods. Neighborhood safety may be relevant to a range of maternal and child health outcomes. The respondent’s perception of their neighborhood may also be used alongside geocoded measures of neighborhood crime statistics to help understand an individuals experience within a neighborhood. Response options for HBCD include the addition of “Don’t know” and “Decline to answer.” In addition, the original measure was scored by averaging all three items, but no scoring is used in HBCD - all responses are item-level only. 

### PACES
Protective and Compensatory Experience (PACES) is a 10-question scale with scores ranging between 0 and 10 assessing positive childhood experiences through age 18 such as: relationships, feeling of connectedness, physical activity, engagement, environment, and opportunities.

    <li>HBCD: "When answering these questions, think about the last 12 months. Please select the response that best describes you."</li>
</ul>
</details>

<p>For responses options, “Declined to answer” was added as an option.</p>
</div>

### Perceived Stress/Social Support
The Perceived Stress and Social Support tools assess caregivers’ perceived stress and emotional support within their social networks longitudinally. These tools combine the PROMIS Emotional Support 4a questionnaire and the Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS-4).

The PROMIS Emotional Support 4a questionnaire (first 4 questions) evaluates the quality of emotional support available to the participant, while the PSS-4 (last 4 questions) measures general perceived stress over the past month. The PSS-4 is a shortened version of the PSS-14, which has been widely used across diverse populations, including pregnant individuals and young families.

Note that the HBCD measures include the addition of response options “Don’t know” and “Decline to answer.” The original measure requires that all items are completed to allow for scoring via the tables provided in the manual, so items with “don’t know” answers will not have a total score reported. If scoring will utilize the PROMIS HealthMeasures Scoring Service, total scores can include missing data (this can be done by individual investigators). For the PSS-4, complete data is essential, and scores should not be reported if any question is answered as “Don’t know.”
