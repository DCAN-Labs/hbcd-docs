## Quick Start Guide for Researchers
In the HBCD Study, researchers collect data using REDCap, a web application for managing surveys and databases. To share and analyze this data, they convert it into the LORIS data dictionary format used for data releases. ReproSchema enables standardized and accurate transformation from REDCap to LORIS, ensuring questionnaire consistency and preserving data integrity across platforms and study phases.
