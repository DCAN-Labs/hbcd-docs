<blockquote>
<p>When writing about mental health symptoms or diagnoses, it is important to use person-centered language. One exception to this is in the area of autism, where there is ongoing dialogue within the affected community about preferred language. It is important to take guidance from those with lived experiences and professional stakeholders when considering any language. Please see the following resources:</p>

<p>Many mental health diagnoses and experiences with mental health care can be influenced by cultural and structural factors that could impact the interpretation of items (symptoms), as well as influenced by previous diagnoses assigned by providers outside the ABCD Study. These cultural and structural factors should be acknowledged, as appropriate.</p>
<p>We recommend statistically examining measurement invariance in mental health measures, considering whether scales and individual items function similarly across demographic groups, and carefully considering the use of measures when bias is demonstrated. It is important for researchers to explicitly acknowledge: (1) potential sources of bias, (2) issues with the measure given evidence of measurement invariance, and/or (3) interpretation limitations that may stem from the use of a given measure.</p>
<p>We recommend following these recommendations for the responsible use and communication of race and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01608-4">ethnicity</a>.</p>

<p>Please note, when using <b>sex assigned at birth</b>, refer to participants as male and female (genders like boys/men and girls/women cannot be inferred from sex alone).</p> 
<p>Depending on the research question, it may be reasonable to include sex, gender, and/or neither variable in your models. For example, if your research question has to do with the biological consequences of sex, using sex may be warranted. If your research question has to do with identity or social determinants of health, gender is likely to be the appropriate variable. Guidance and references for when and how to use sex and/or gender can be found here. https://data.abcdstudy.org/reports/wiki-release6/data-doc/non-imaging/gender-and-sexuality.html#imp-gender</p>
