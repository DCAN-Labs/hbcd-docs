<p>Please note, when using <b>sex assigned at birth</b>, refer to participants as male and female (genders like boys/men and girls/women cannot be inferred from sex alone).</p> 
<p>Depending on the research question, it may be reasonable to include sex, gender, and/or neither variable in your models. For example, if your research question has to do with the biological consequences of sex, using sex may be warranted. If your research question has to do with identity or social determinants of health, gender is likely to be the appropriate variable. Guidance and references for when and how to use sex and/or gender can be found here. https://data.abcdstudy.org/reports/wiki-release6/data-doc/non-imaging/gender-and-sexuality.html#imp-gender</p>
