Time-frequency plots overlaid by electrode position for subject data with artifact. Note that there is an influence of this artifact in the electrodes surrounding E55:

Average time-frequency across all subjects at E55 including subject data with artifact on the left and excluding it on the right:

Time-frequency of all data of other release subjects, excluding subject data with artifact, at E55. None of these participants show the artifact at E55:

## Effects On ERP Derivatives 
While the artifact is present at channel E55, it does not appear in the regions of interest (ROIs) for the **VEP** (left image) and **FACE** (right image) tasks, as illustrated for the Oz ROI for the subject data with artifact below:

For the **MMN** task, channel E55 is not used in the T7/T8 ROI, and the artifact does not appear in this region:

**However**, the FCz cluster includes electrodes E12 and E112 which may be affected by the artifact:
