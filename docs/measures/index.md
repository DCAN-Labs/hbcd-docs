# Data Measures & Quality Control

## Information Provided
In this section we provide a brief overview of each data measure provided in the data release, including, where applicable, details of implementation and data collection, scoring procedures, quality control procedures, known issues, and references. For measures that include surveys, all surveys were translated to Spanish for HBCD by [BURG Translations](https://burgtranslations.com/our-services/) as part of inclusion and equity efforts driven by the HBCD Spanish Language and Culture Committee (SLCC) [Anunziata et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2024.101477).

The visits and corresponding ages of the infant/child are listed below. **Only data measures provided in the current release that includes V01 - V03 are described**. Please visit the [HBCD Study page](https://hbcdstudy.org/study-protocols/) for full study protocols.

## Responsible Use & Expert Review Warnings
To promote responsible use of the data and offer additional context for users, warnings are displayed at the top of each measure/instrument section as necessary. These warnings have been incorporated into the data dictionary that link directly to the release notes. We encourage all data users to examine the warnings for any variables you plan to download/utilize and adhere to the recommended guidelines. 

**For consistency with [ABCD study data release](https://data.abcdstudy.org/reports/wiki-release6/) also hosted on the NBDC Lasso platform, Responsible Data Use Warnings for overlapping measures were provided by the ABCD Wiki (see additional information [here](https://data.abcdstudy.org/reports/wiki-release6/jedi.html#warnings-in-release-noteswiki)). These warnings are clearly labeled as such and contain a direct link to the Wiki source, as is demonstrated in the example and explanation below.** 

There are two types of warnings:

<p>The Expert Review warnings offer critical guidance from subject matter experts, tailored specifically to the context of HBCD measures and data. These warnings address considerations and recommendations for measure usage, highlight known issues, and provide important reminders. Additionally, they include detailed instructions and/or code to assist researchers with various aspects of data use, such as working with datasets, calculating variables, or performing specific analyses. This information is designed to enhance transparency, promote best practices, and streamline the use of each measure or data type.</p>
