# Data Measures & Quality Control

## Information Provided
In this section we provide a brief overview of each data measure provided in the data release, including, where applicable, details of implementation and data collection, scoring procedures, quality control procedures and known issues, and references. For measures that include surveys, all surveys were translated to Spanish for HBCD by [BURG Translations](https://burgtranslations.com/our-services/) as part of inclusion and equity efforts driven by the HBCD Spanish Language and Culture Committee (SLCC) [Anunziata et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2024.101477).

The visits and corresponding ages of the infant/child are listed below. **Only data measures provided in the current release that includes V01 - V03 are described**. Please visit the [HBCD Study page](https://hbcdstudy.org/study-protocols/) for full study protocols.

## Responsible Use & Expert Review Warnings
To promote responsible use of the data and offer additional context for users, warnings are displayed at the top of each measure/instrument section where relevant. These warnings have been incorporated into the data dictionary that link directly to the release notes. We encourage all data users to examine the warnings for any variables you plan to download/utilize and adhere to the recommended guidelines. There are two types of warnings:
