# Neurocognition & Language: Multilingual Language Development Screener
## Measure Overview
**Full Name**: Multilingual Language Development Screener    
**Acronym/Brief Name**: MLDS    
**Construct**: Multilingual exposure       
**Description**: This measure is assessing the child’s exposure to languages and whether there are concerns about the child’s hearing. A series of forced choice questions were used to elicit the responses and slide scales were used to assess the percentage of time a child is exposed to a given language in their various environments (i.e., home, daycare, other family member household, babysitter). Up to ten non-parental childcare arrangements were sampled. The measure was designed to inform the site’s assessment team prior to assessments related to neurocognitive and language functioning. Responses are used to determine who was able to conduct the cognitive and language assessments (i.e., English or Spanish speaking) and to document additional challenges to completing assessments (hearing impairment, other languages). This was a questionnaire developed specifically for HBCD to inform assessment process. Caregivers opt for their child’s assessment to be performed in either English or Spanish for in person performance tasks (i.e., NIH Baby Toolbox, Bayley-4, or Deferred Imitation) by selecting between a forced choice of English or Spanish. For the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDI), an algorithm was used to determine if the CDI is done in English only, English and Spanish,  English only, or not at all.   
**Summary**: This instrument involves a series of questionnaires that assess parental concern regarding the child’s hearing and the presence of English, Spanish, or Other languages in the child’s home and childcare environments. 

**General Scoring Description and Procedure**  

*Non-parental childcare arrangements:* 

For up to 10 non-parental childcare arrangements, total days per week and total hours per day were calculated from the sum of days/week and hours/day, respectively, spent in non-parental childcare arrangements: `Daycare`, `With Babysitter`, `With other family members outside of the household`, and `Other non-parental childcare arrangement`.

Frequency of English and Spanish was quantified for each environment as follows:

 * only in Spanish: child’s language environment has >= 30% Spanish AND < 30% English
 * only in English: child’s language environment has >= 30% English AND < 30% Spanish
 * in both languages (still pending Steering Committee voting): child’s language environment has >= 30% Spanish AND >= 30% English
 * neither Spanish nor English: child’s language environment has < 30% Spanish AND < 30% Englis

The total frequency of Spanish and English was then computed by multiplying the percentage of English and Spanish language provided per environment by the total hours per week in both the home and other care environments. The values are provided for home and for the overall total child experience, combining home and other care environments.

## Implementation & Data Collection
**Method of Administration**: This measure is completed remotely by caregivers prior to when cognitive and language assessments will be performed. If the caregiver does not complete the assessment remotely, it is conducted at the visit to document the child’s language exposure environments. The instrument can be administered by an RA in person or via video as needed.

## Quality Control & Known Issues
**QC Procedures:** Frequency of decline to answer and completeness was monitored during data collection.        
**Common Issues Identified:** Initial data shows that about 10% of questionnaires were not complete.
