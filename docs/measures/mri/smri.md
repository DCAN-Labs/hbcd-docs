# Structural MRI (sMRI)
*See [Overview](overview.md) for details on quality control and [MRI Protocols](../../mriprotocols/overview.md) for information on sequence installation. All structural MRI (sMRI) data were acquired during visits V02, V03, V04, and V06. A full description of structural MRI protocol design for the HBCD Study, summarized below, is described in [Dean et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2024.101452).*

HBCD protocols for structural MRI were informed by recent large-scale developmental neuroimaging studies including ABCD, HCP Lifespan, and BCP. These studies provided a solid starting point for the development of well-validated, high-resolution protocols harmonized across all three major scanner vendors (Casey et al., 2018) and the importance of T2w acquisition in infants due to suboptimal grey/white T1w contrast resulting from incomplete myelination (Howell et al., 2019, Myers et al., 2023).

In addition to being shaped by prior studies, HBCD protocols were adapted in the following ways. The target duration in the MRI protocol for the T1w and T2w structural scans was seven minutes total. Previous studies (e.g., ABCD and BCP) took more than 12 minutes. Scanners across all three vendors and sites were able to achieve 0.8 mm isotropic resolution acquisitions with acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) using 32- or 64- channel coils. All sites were also able to support embedded navigators for prospective motion detection, real-time monitoring, and real-time correction (White et al., 2010, Tisdall et al., 2016, Andersen et al., 2019). Finally, instead of optimizing protocols by age, constant structural protocols were maintained over the study duration. This approach was intended to better allow longitudinal effects to reflect developmental differences rather than protocol differences.

The final HBCD structural imaging protocol is both significantly faster (under 9 minutes) and higher resolution (0.8 mm isotropic) than any previous multi-vendor and multi-site study. The protocol includes advanced acceleration methods and motion navigators for T1w and T2w protocols, enabling fast and robust structural imaging of the developing brain.
