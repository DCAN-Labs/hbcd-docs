**Full Name**: Early Childhood Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Child/Caregiver Relationship Scale.  
**Acronym/Brief Name**: ecPROMIS Child-Caregiver Interaction    
**Construct**: Relationships  

The Early Childhood Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (ecPROMIS) offers clinicians and researchers a brief, efficient, and precise way to evaluate young children’s well-being. The ecPROMIS Child-Caregiver Relationship Scale assesses the degree to which young children develop close, satisfying relationships with caregivers. Questions inquire about the focal child/caregiver relationship over the past 7 days. The ecPROMIS Child/Caregiver relationship form (Infancy: < 1 year) was developed for HBCD based on the “PROMIS Early Childhood Parent-Report Short Form v1.0 - Social Relationships – Child-Caregiver Interactions 5a” form.

Each of the 5 items for ecPROMIS Child-Caregiver Interaction is answered on a scale of 1-5: 1, Never 2, Rarely 3, Sometimes 4, Often 5, Always. A sum score is generated when the caregiver answers at least 3 out of the 5 items (*ecpromis1*, *ecpromis2*, *ecpromis3*, *ecpromis4*, *ecpromis5*). If caregivers answer 3 or 4 items, a prorated sum score is calculated using the formula: `(sum of items answered/the number of items answered)*5`. If fewer than 3 items are completed, the sum score is marked as missing.

## HBCD Modifications
The original ecPROMIS measure items use the term ‘my child,’ as they are designed for children aged 1 to 5 years. To make them suitable for the pre-V03 age range (3 to 9 months), Dr. Dave Cella and Dr. Courtney Blackwell, developers of ecPROMIS, provided guidance to adapt the items by replacing ‘my child’ with ‘my baby.’ See additional general modifications made to Behavior and Caregiver-Child Interactions measures [here](overview.md#hbcd-modifications).
