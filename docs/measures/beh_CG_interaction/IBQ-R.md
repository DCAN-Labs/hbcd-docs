# IBQ-R Very Short Form + Behavioral Inhibition
**Full Name**: Infant Behavior Questionnaire – Revised Very Short Form + Behavior Inhibition  
**Acronym/Brief Name**: IBQ-R (VSF)+BI       
**Construct**: Temperamental Surgency/Extraversion, Negative Affectivity, Effortful Control, and Behavioral Inhibition

The IBQ-R (VSF)+BI is a caregiver report form used to assess temperamental reactivity and regulation in infancy, focusing on key traits that influence development and behavior during the early years. It is adapted from the well-validated IBQ-R Very Short Form with additional items reflecting Behavioral Inhibition from the long form of the IBQ-R.

For the purposes of HBCD, the measure consists of 4 scale domains: surgency/extraversion (13 items), negative affectivity (12 items), effortful control (12 items), and behavioral inhibition (13 items). Caregivers are asked to report on the infant’s behaviors on a 7-point Likert scale: 1 [Never], 2 [Very rarely], 3 [Less than half the time], 4 [About half the time], 5 [More than half the time], 6 [Almost always], 7 [Always].

Scale scores generated for each domain are the mean score of all scale items applicable to the child as judged by the caregiver (`sum of item scores / total # of items` per domain). Importantly, this calculation only includes items with scores of 1 through 7: items where the caregiver selects "does not apply" or “choose not to respond" receive no numerical score and are not included in the total number of items for the scale. Items with an “R” are reverse scored and already implemented in the HBCD scoring algorithm. 

For additional information, please see the scoring manual for details on items and scales as well as [Mary Rothbart's Temperament Questionnaires](https://research.bowdoin.edu/rothbart-temperament-questionnaires).

## HBCD Modifications

As mentioned in the measure description, in addition to the overall *Surgency, Negative Affect and Effortful Control* scales derived from the validated IBQ-R-VSF, the HBCD Workgroup and measure experts added a Behavior Inhibition (or Social Fear) scale using items from the long form of the IBQ-R (IBQ-R-LF), including:
