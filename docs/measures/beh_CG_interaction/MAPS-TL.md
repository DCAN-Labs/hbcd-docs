# MAPS-TL
**Full Name**: Multidimensional Assessment Profiles - Temper Loss scale.  
**Acronym/Brief Name**: MAPS-TL  
**Construct**: Irritability  
  
Multidimensional Assessment Profiles- Temper Loss scale (MAPS-TL) is a well-validated survey assessing irritability that serves as a tool for characterizing the developmental expression of early mental health risk. MAPS-TL measures a range of behaviors that encompass dysregulation, responsiveness to environmental input, and context. Questions inquire about the behaviors of the focal child over the past month. Irritability has been identified as an early dimensional marker of lifespan mental health risk. MAPS-TL aims to delineate the typical-to-atypical spectrum of irritability in early childhood and identify those young children at high probability of subsequent adaptational problems based on problems with dysregulation. 
    
Each of the 17 items for MAPS-TL is answered on a scale of 1-6: 1 [Never], 2 [Rarely (Less than once per week)], 3 [Some (1-3) days of the week], 4 [Most (4-6) days of the week], 5 [Every day of the week], 6 [Many times each day]. A **sum score** is generated when the caregiver provides a numerical score of 1 to 6 for at least 9 out of the 17 items. If fewer than 9 items are completed, the score is marked as missing. When responses are available for 9 to 16 items, a prorated score is calculated using the formula: `(sum of items answered / number of items answered) * 17`.

## HBCD Modifications
Measure instructions and individuals items that reference gendered pronouns (‘his/hers’, ‘he/she’) were edited to either eliminate the pronouns entirely, or edited to replace gendered pronouns with ‘my child’ when eliminating pronouns was not grammatically possible. Items referencing “parent” were edited to “parent/caregiver.” Because MAPS-TL psychometric validation was done using original MAPS-TL items, it is important that publications account for edits made to individual items as part of HBCD DEI review.

## Quality Control & Known Issues 
QC procedures included examining the range of the child’s age to ensure that it falls within 3 to 9 months; examining missingness; calculate sum scores and means applying our prorated scoring rule; generating summary statistics and visualizations for item-level frequencies, age, and scores; and using Calculate Cronbach's Alpha for reliability.
