<b>Gestational Age at Administration</b> (<code>&lt;instrument_name&gt;_gestational_age</code>): 'GAA' is the time from the first day of the birth parent’s last menstrual period (LMP), estimated as EDD minus 280 days, to the instrument administration date. GAA is given in whole weeks, rounded down, for only the V01 visit. For a given participant, GAA typically varies by no more than 4 weeks across protocol elements except in cases where protocol exceptions were granted.
<br>
<br>
<b>Chronological Age at Administration</b> (<code>&lt;instrument_name&gt;_candidate_age</code>): Reported in years (to three decimal places), chronological age is the time from birth (with the birthdate jittered up to 7 days to mitigate identification risks) to the date of instrument administration (for V02 onward). It is calculated by dividing the total days elapsed (rounded down) by 365.25. Reporting in years, rather than months, ensures consistency across developmental stages (e.g., toddlerhood, childhood), while three-decimal precision compensates for birthdate adjustments, yielding values closer to actual age.
<br>
<br>
<b>Adjusted Chronological Age at Administration</b> (<code>&lt;instrument_name&gt;_adjusted_age</code>): 'ACAA' is the time elapsed between the estimated date of delivery (EDD) and date of instrument administration (for V02 onward), reported in whole weeks rounded down to the nearest week.

**Basic Demographics** data (<code>sed_basic_demographics.tsv</code>) includes an additional set of fields reporting age - please see [Basic Demographics](../measures/demographics.md#basic-demographics) for more information:

<i>Note that all of the following are single-point and static values.</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>Maternal Age at V01 </b> (<code>mother_age_v01</code>): 'MAV01' is the birth parent's age, obtained from the scheduled date of the V01 visit. Reported in years to two decimal places, with fractional years calculated by dividing the number of whole months (rounded down) by 12.
<br>
<br>
<b>Maternal Age at Delivery</b> (<code>mother_age_delivery</code>): 'MAD' is the birth parent’s age at the time of their child's delivery (date of birth). Reported in years to two decimal places, with fractional years calculated by dividing the total whole months (rounded down) by 12.
<br>
<br>
<b>Gestational Age at Delivery</b> (<code>gestational_age_delivery</code>): 'GAD' is the time elapsed between the first day of the birth parent’s last menstrual period (LMP) and the child's date of birth. Reported in whole weeks, rounded down to the nearest week.<br>
