# Reporting Issues (WGs only)

*NOTE: This section will not be included in the final webpage for the release, but instead offers a central location for internal documentation to assist HBCD researchers and stakeholders in preparation for the release.*

## Lasso Help Center

- Any issues with your data.

## Updates to HBCD Data Release webpage content
If you identify any errors or updates needed in the content of this webpage, please report them by either submitting an issue on the [hbcd-docs GitHub](https://github.com/DCAN-Labs/hbcd-docs/issues) or by contacting me, Luci Moore, directly via Slack or email. For more complex updates requiring discussion, Slack or email is preferred.

Please note that I also receive updates through other channels (e.g., Workgroup README templates) and strive to incorporate changes promptly upon notification. However, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have questions or concerns.
