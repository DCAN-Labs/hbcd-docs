# Reporting Issues (with additional instructions for internal HBCD members)

This section is similar to the main [Report Issues](../reportissue.md) section except that it contains additional details useful for internal members in preparation for the release

## User Feedback Requested
We ask that users report the following:

1. Any issues with their data. 
2. Any issues in the Data Dictionary for their WGs measures. 
3. Any feedback or feature request that can make the process of querying and analyzing better and easier for them. 
4. Any bugs that they may encounter in Lasso. 

The WG training videos are based off of the Read Me docs (they answer questions like which instruments fall under which WG, how are they scored and QCed, derived variables relevant for analysis, and how to query multi-modal within lasso). We also plan to create "How-to do anything in Lasso" videos soon.

**Once your ticket is submitted, Aarushi Chaudhry will reply as quickly as possible and you will receive an email notification from Lasso. If you think this process it going to take time or just want to share quick thought, you can also email Aarushi directly - we are not fussy about the tracker at this point, we just want the feedback in any form.**
