<p>Implicit in responsible stewardship of prenatal drug exposure data is the recognition of the structural racism in which drug policy in the United States has long been embedded (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0892-0362(93)90024-i">Coles 1993</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000004786">Wakeman et al., 2022</a>). Responsible use of prenatal drug exposure data also requires thoughtful interpretation of exposure-related outcomes in the context of measured and unmeasured confounders. These confounders include, but are not limited to, phenotypic risks associated with persistent alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use during pregnancy by birthing parents (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1521-0391.2010.00110.x">Massey et al., 2010</a>), and confounding by familial risk from within-family studies (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10519-015-9762-2">Estabrook et al., 2016<a>).</p>
<p>Finally, unwarranted speculation about ‘neural bases of behavior’ form differences in neuroimaging between exposed and unexposed children in the absence of differences in behavioral performance can exacerbate stigma already faced by birthing parents with substance use disorders and their children (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ntt.2015.07.002">McAllister & Hart 2015</a>).</p>

<p>It was difficult for some participants to self-report the typical size of a single drink (in oz) to capture ‘standard drinks’ of alcohol for Assist, leading to some reports falling outside the expected range. Similarly, reporting the frequency of use for substances like electronic cigarette devices proved difficult, resulting in outliers. While sites were queried on these outliers, participants could not always be re-contacted for clarification.</p>

<td style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: normal;">Response distributions are reviewed for outliers and additionally cross-checked with TLFB to ensure consistency in reported substances. One common issue was that reported substances used on the TLFB were not always noted on the Assist V1/V2, which triggered a query to the site to correct it.</td></tr>

## Instrument Details

The Assist V1, V2, and V3 measures combine questions from the Family History Assessment Module (FHAM) and the All of Us Personal and Family Health History, which was then modified from the [NIDA Quick Screen (Modified Assist)](https://nida.nih.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/nmassist.pdf). The original quick screen was scored; however, our version is not scored. To acknowledge these changes in future publications, authors can note that questions were motivated from the NIDA Modified Assist.

The NIDA quick screen tool (*have you used alcohol, tobacco, prescription drugs, or illegal drugs in the last year*) was removed and replaced by questions to assess more details regarding types of substances used and the timeline of use before and during pregnancy. 

In addition, for lifetime and problematic use, and use pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, end-pregnancy, post-pregnancy, and past 3 months, use was expanded into the substances listed below for HBCD. For each substance, participants indicate whether they had ever used it and, if endorsed, frequency of use with options: 0 (Never), 1 (Once or Twice), 2 (Monthly), 3 (Weekly), or 4 (Daily or Almost Daily). For substances reported as used pre-pregnancy, during pregnancy, and end-pregnancy, participants were asked about modes of use and typical quantities/amounts of consumption for alcohol and opioids (if applicable). 

Finally, the Time Line Follow Back (TLFB) was triggered when substance use was reported before [pre-use] or during pregnancy [during_use] on the Assist V1 or at the end of pregnancy [end_use] on the ASSIST V2 (see documentation on TLFB).
