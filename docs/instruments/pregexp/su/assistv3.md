<p>It was difficult for some participants to self-report the typical size of a single drink (in oz) to capture ‘standard drinks’ of alcohol for Assist, leading to some reports falling outside the expected range. Similarly, reporting the frequency of use for substances like electronic cigarette devices proved difficult, resulting in outliers. While sites were queried on these outliers, participants could not always be re-contacted for clarification.</p>

## Instrument Details

The Assist V1, V2, and V3 measures combine questions from the Family History Assessment Module (FHAM) and the All of Us Personal and Family Health History, which was then modified from the [NIDA Quick Screen (Modified Assist)](https://nida.nih.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/nmassist.pdf). The original quick screen was scored; however, our version is not scored. To acknowledge these changes in future publications, authors can note that questions were motivated from the NIDA Modified Assist.

The NIDA quick screen tool (*have you used alcohol, tobacco, prescription drugs, or illegal drugs in the last year*) was removed and replaced by questions to assess more details regarding types of substances used and the timeline of use before and during pregnancy. 

In addition, for lifetime and problematic use, and use pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, end-pregnancy, post-pregnancy, and past 3 months, use was expanded into the substances listed below for HBCD. For each substance, participants indicate whether they had ever used it and, if endorsed, frequency of use with options: 0 (Never), 1 (Once or Twice), 2 (Monthly), 3 (Weekly), or 4 (Daily or Almost Daily). For substances reported as used pre-pregnancy, during pregnancy, and end-pregnancy, participants were asked about modes of use and typical quantities/amounts of consumption for alcohol and opioids (if applicable).
