## Implementation & Data Collection
Surveys were translated to Spanish for HBCD by [BURG Translations](https://burgtranslations.com/our-services/). All of the instruments are child-unspecific with the exception of **Healthv2 Inf**. Additional information is as follows:

## Quality Control
For all instruments, quality control was performed by reviewing response distributions for outliers. Substance use instruments were additionally cross-checked between the TLFB and ASSIST V1/V2 to ensure consistency in reported substances. One common issue was that reported substances used on the TLFB were not always noted on the Assist V1/V2, which triggered a query to the site to correct it.


## Mental Health
### Personal & Family Psychiatric History 
The HBCD FAM MH assesses self-reported diagnoses and mental health conditions of the biological mother, biological father, and biological maternal and paternal grandmother and grandfather. It was created from combining and modifying items from the [Family History Assessment Module (FHAM)](https://arc.psych.wisc.edu/self-report/family-history-assessment-module-fham/) and the [All of Us Personal and Family Health History](https://www.researchallofus.org/wp-content/themes/research-hub-wordpress-theme/media/2023/PaFHH_Survey_English.pdf). The HBCD FAM MH includes (1) FHAM items on alcohol use [alc], drug use [drug], depression [dep], mania [man], and Schizophrenia [sch]; and (2) All of Us mental health outcomes for only biological mother [bm] and biological father [bf]: Alcohol Use Disorder [001], Anxiety disorder or panic disorder [002], Autism Spectrum Disorder [003], Bipolar disorder [004], Depressive disorder [005], Drug or Substance Use Disorder [006], Schizophrenia [007], and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) [008], excluding questions about age of diagnosis, treatment, and medications. Future publications should note that this measure is a combination of these and that this is not a scored scale, but simply descriptive for family psychiatric history.

<p><b>FHAM</b></p>
<p>FAM MH excludes the following FHAM items: (1) items for Antisocial Personality Disorder [ASP] and Undifferentiated Psychiatric Disorder [UPD] and (2) items asking about any treatment for mental or emotional problems, hospitalization, and suicide. In addition, the original response options including 'parents', 'grandparents', 'siblings', 'aunts', 'uncles', and 'cousins' were modified to include only biological mom [001], biological dad [002], biological maternal grandmother [003], biological maternal grandfather [004], biological paternal grandmother [005], and biological paternal grandfather [006].</p>
<p><b>All of Us</b></p>
<p>Original response options including 'mom', 'dad', 'sibling', 'daughter', 'son', and 'grandparent' were modified to include only biological mother [bm] and biological father [bf]. Follow-up questions about age of diagnosis, treatment, and medications were excluded.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px; border-bottom: 1px solid #6b6b6b66;"><strong>Consideration of Mental Health Symptoms Experienced During Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>Concurrence of psychiatric symptoms and substance use is well-recognized during pregnancy (Massey et al., 2011, 2012). Phenotypic risk in birthing parents may influence neurodevelopmental outcomes via prenatal and postnatal influences other than direct exposures alone (Estabrook et al., 2016, Massey et al., 2016, Massey et al., 2018). These influences may confound exposure-related neuroimaging and neurodevelopmental findings, and also represent malleable targets for prevention and early intervention. Thus, consideration of mental health symptoms experienced by birthing parents as covariates is strongly encouraged when possible to address these confounds.</p>

</p>

The DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 and Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure (APA 1/2) was adapted for HBCD by combining the following measures: the [DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure—Adult](https://www.psychiatry.org/getmedia/e0b4b299-95b3-407b-b8c2-caa871ca218d/APA-DSM5TR-Level1MeasureAdult.pdf) and the [DSM-5 Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/educational-resources/assessment-measures):

![](images/DSM-5Level2Cross-CuttingSymptomMeasures.png)

**Level 1** includes 1-2 questions for each of eleven mental health domains, with scores calculated for depression, anger, mania, anxiety, somatic symptoms, suicidal ideation, psychosis, sleep disturbance, memory, repetitive behaviors, and dissociation. Note that Level 1 items for personality functioning and substance use were excluded. See Level 1 scoring procedures [here](https://www.psychiatry.org/getmedia/e0b4b299-95b3-407b-b8c2-caa871ca218d/APA-DSM5TR-Level1MeasureAdult.pdf). If symptoms are reported in Level 1, participants are subsequently administered the corresponding Level 2 symptom measure associated with each mental health domain, including anger, anxiety, depression, mania, somatic symptoms, repetitive thoughts, and sleep problems.

**Level 2** measures include all [Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/educational-resources/assessment-measures) with the exception of Substance Abuse. The Level 2 measures for Depression and Sleep Disturbance were replaced with the **PROMIS Short Forms v1.0** [Depression 8a questionnaire](https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/toolkit_content/supplemental_info/psychiatric/measures/07_Depressed_Mood.doc) and [Sleep Disturbance 8a](https://heal.nih.gov/files/CDEs/2024-07/promis-sleep-disturbance-8a-crf.pdf). Documentation for each measure and its scoring can be found [here](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/educational-resources/assessment-measures). PROMIS scoring procedures for Depression can be found [here](https://www.healthmeasures.net/images/PROMIS/manuals/Scoring_Manual_Only/PROMIS_Depression_Scoring_Manual_05Dec2023.pdf) and for Sleep Disturbance can be found [here](https://www.healthmeasures.net/images/PROMIS/manuals/Scoring_Manual_Only/PROMIS_Sleep_Scoring_Manual.pdf).

Finally, the HBCD measure also integrates the [Personality Inventory for DSM-5 Brief](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_The-Personality-Inventory-For-DSM-5-Brief-Form-Adult.pdf), which assesses five personality trait domains including negative affect, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition, and psychoticism. Scoring for the Personality Inventory can be found [here](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_The-Personality-Inventory-For-DSM-5-Brief-Form-Adult.pdf).

Additional modifications are described below. Future publications should be sure to acknowledge the removal of Level 1 and 2 substance use and the gating mechanisms for somatic symptoms and personality inventory:

<div class="closed-collapsible-content">
<br>
<p style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>Excluded Questions and Gating</b></p>
<p>Slight modifications were made due to the use of other measures and the study population. Specifically, the Level 1 questions for substance use and personality functioning were not included. Also, all participants answer the level 1 questions on depression and somatic symptoms but proceed to level 2 questions irrespective of answers; all participants proceed automatically to the level 2 measure for personality inventory.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>Clinical Alerts</b></p>
<p>For HBCD, this measure was modified to alert study staff if responses to the Level 1 APA self-harm question ('Thoughts of actually hurting yourself?') or Level 2 APA depression questionnaire (items from 'I felt worthless' to 'I felt that nothing could cheer me up') exceed thresholds of 0 and 32, respectively.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>Response Option Changes</b></p>
<p>For HBCD, the response option ‘Decline to answer’ was added to all questions. The response option ‘Don’t know’ was also included at the beginning of data collection, but was subsequently removed. Note that this does not impact scoring as questions answered with ‘Decline to answer’ or ‘Don’t know’ are skipped and marked as missing.</p> 

<p>Note that in early data releases, total scores are not calculated for Level 2 measures. Users are encouraged to score individual scales themselves according to the scoring procedures linked above.</p>
