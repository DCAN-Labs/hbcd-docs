## Quality Control
For all instruments, quality control was performed by reviewing response distributions for outliers. Substance use instruments were additionally cross-checked between the TLFB and ASSIST V1/V2 to ensure consistency in reported substances. One common issue was that reported substances used on the TLFB were not always noted on the Assist V1/V2, which triggered a query to the site to correct it.

<p style="margin-bottom: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px; border-bottom: 1px solid #6b6b6b66;"><strong>Pregnancy Health (<code>Healthhx</code>): Pregnancy intention as a determinant of exposure</strong></p>
<p>Amidst powerful societal expectations to ‘do what’s best for the baby’ during pregnancy (i.e. by stopping substance use), up to half of pregnancies in the United States are unintended with 1 in 5 unwanted (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30315-6">Bearak et al. 2020</a>). This discrepancy contributes to implicit bias against pregnant individuals who use substances as ‘not caring about their babies’ which is neither humane, nor evidence based (Massey et al., 2022). While cessation of substance use during pregnancy is universally recognized as optimal, the ability to make this “parental” sacrifice varies substantially between birthing individuals and within individuals between their different pregnancies (Level et al., 2024). Failure to recognize this inherent heterogeneity in pregnancy intention stigmatizes substance users who did not intend to want to become pregnant. Summarily, inclusion of pregnancy intention as a covariate in all studies that characterize prenatal substance exposure (in the absence of a strong justification otherwise) is thus strongly recommended to acknowledge myriad experiences of birthing parents who participated in HBCD who made this research possible.</p>

For instruments utilizing these coding systems, it was at times difficult for the participant to name or HBCD Study team member conducting the survey to find the correct code/name in a databases.

## Mental Health
### Personal & Family Psychiatric History 
The HBCD FAM MH assesses self-reported diagnoses and mental health conditions of the biological mother, biological father, and biological maternal and paternal grandmother and grandfather. It was created from combining and modifying items from the [Family History Assessment Module (FHAM)](https://arc.psych.wisc.edu/self-report/family-history-assessment-module-fham/) and the [All of Us Personal and Family Health History](https://www.researchallofus.org/wp-content/themes/research-hub-wordpress-theme/media/2023/PaFHH_Survey_English.pdf). The HBCD FAM MH includes (1) FHAM items on alcohol use [alc], drug use [drug], depression [dep], mania [man], and Schizophrenia [sch]; and (2) All of Us mental health outcomes for only biological mother [bm] and biological father [bf]: Alcohol Use Disorder [001], Anxiety disorder or panic disorder [002], Autism Spectrum Disorder [003], Bipolar disorder [004], Depressive disorder [005], Drug or Substance Use Disorder [006], Schizophrenia [007], and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) [008], excluding questions about age of diagnosis, treatment, and medications. Future publications should note that this measure is a combination of these and that this is not a scored scale, but simply descriptive for family psychiatric history.

<p style="margin-bottom: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px; border-bottom: 1px solid #6b6b6b66;"><strong>Consideration of Mental Health Symptoms Experienced During Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>Concurrence of psychiatric symptoms and substance use is well-recognized during pregnancy (Massey et al., 2011, 2012). Phenotypic risk in birthing parents may influence neurodevelopmental outcomes via prenatal and postnatal influences other than direct exposures alone (Estabrook et al., 2016, Massey et al., 2016, Massey et al., 2018). These influences may confound exposure-related neuroimaging and neurodevelopmental findings, and also represent malleable targets for prevention and early intervention. Thus, consideration of mental health symptoms experienced by birthing parents as covariates is strongly encouraged when possible to address these confounds.</p> 
</div>
</p>

The DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 and Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure (APA 1/2) was adapted for HBCD by combining the following measures: the [DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure—Adult](https://www.psychiatry.org/getmedia/e0b4b299-95b3-407b-b8c2-caa871ca218d/APA-DSM5TR-Level1MeasureAdult.pdf) and the [DSM-5 Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/educational-resources/assessment-measures):

![](images/DSM-5Level2Cross-CuttingSymptomMeasures.png)

**Level 1** includes 1-2 questions for each of eleven mental health domains, with scores calculated for depression, anger, mania, anxiety, somatic symptoms, suicidal ideation, psychosis, sleep disturbance, memory, repetitive behaviors, and dissociation. Note that Level 1 items for personality functioning and substance use were excluded. See Level 1 scoring procedures [here](https://www.psychiatry.org/getmedia/e0b4b299-95b3-407b-b8c2-caa871ca218d/APA-DSM5TR-Level1MeasureAdult.pdf). If symptoms are reported in Level 1, participants are subsequently administered the corresponding Level 2 symptom measure associated with each mental health domain, including anger, anxiety, depression, mania, somatic symptoms, repetitive thoughts, and sleep problems.

**Level 2** measures include all [Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/educational-resources/assessment-measures) with the exception of Substance Abuse. The Level 2 measures for Depression and Sleep Disturbance were replaced with the **PROMIS Short Forms v1.0** [Depression 8a questionnaire](https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/toolkit_content/supplemental_info/psychiatric/measures/07_Depressed_Mood.doc) and [Sleep Disturbance 8a](https://heal.nih.gov/files/CDEs/2024-07/promis-sleep-disturbance-8a-crf.pdf). Documentation for each measure and its scoring can be found [here](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/educational-resources/assessment-measures). PROMIS scoring procedures for Depression can be found [here](https://www.healthmeasures.net/images/PROMIS/manuals/Scoring_Manual_Only/PROMIS_Depression_Scoring_Manual_05Dec2023.pdf) and for Sleep Disturbance can be found [here](https://www.healthmeasures.net/images/PROMIS/manuals/Scoring_Manual_Only/PROMIS_Sleep_Scoring_Manual.pdf).

Finally, the HBCD measure also integrates the [Personality Inventory for DSM-5 Brief](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_The-Personality-Inventory-For-DSM-5-Brief-Form-Adult.pdf), which assesses five personality trait domains including negative affect, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition, and psychoticism. Scoring for the Personality Inventory can be found [here](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_The-Personality-Inventory-For-DSM-5-Brief-Form-Adult.pdf).

Additional modifications are described below. Future publications should be sure to acknowledge the removal of Level 1 and 2 substance use and the gating mechanisms for somatic symptoms and personality inventory:

<div class="closed-collapsible-content">
<br>
<p style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>Excluded Questions and Gating</b></p>
<p>Slight modifications were made due to the use of other measures and the study population. Specifically, the Level 1 questions for substance use and personality functioning were not included. Also, all participants answer the level 1 questions on depression and somatic symptoms but proceed to level 2 questions irrespective of answers; all participants proceed automatically to the level 2 measure for personality inventory.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>Clinical Alerts</b></p>
<p>For HBCD, this measure was modified to alert study staff if responses to the Level 1 APA self-harm question ('Thoughts of actually hurting yourself?') or Level 2 APA depression questionnaire (items from 'I felt worthless' to 'I felt that nothing could cheer me up') exceed thresholds of 0 and 32, respectively.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>Response Option Changes</b></p>
<p>For HBCD, the response option ‘Decline to answer’ was added to all questions. The response option ‘Don’t know’ was also included at the beginning of data collection, but was subsequently removed. Note that this does not impact scoring as questions answered with ‘Decline to answer’ or ‘Don’t know’ are skipped and marked as missing.</p> 

<p>Note that in early data releases, total scores are not calculated for Level 2 measures. Users are encouraged to score individual scales themselves according to the scoring procedures linked above.</p>

</p>

The HBCD Severity of Posttraumatic/Acute Stress Symptoms measure was developed to assess the severity of PTSD and acute stress symptoms following a traumatic event (for individuals aged 18 and older). It combines items from two surveys from the National Stressful Events Surveys: items 1-9 from the PTSD Short Scale ([NSESSS-PTSD](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Posttraumatic-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf)) and item 3 from the Acute Stress Disorder Short Scale ([NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Acute-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf)) into a single 10-item assessment for the HBCD study.  Responses are scored 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 and responses to items are summed for a total score. For HBCD, the response option ‘Decline to answer’ was added to all questions. The response option ‘Don’t know’ was also included at the beginning of data collection, but was subsequently removed. Future publications should note that this measure combines NSESSS-PTSD and NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder.

**Questionnaire prompt/instructions:**    
*People sometimes have problems after extremely stressful events or experiences. How much have you been bothered during the PAST SEVEN (7) DAYS by each of the following problems that occurred or became worse after an extremely stressful event/experience?*

<p>Scores on these scales assess trauma-related stress symptoms and do not differentiate between PTSD and Acute Stress Disorder. Researchers should review individual items on each scale to determine the most relevant scale to their research. Individual total scores are provided for NSESSS-PTSD and NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder, and are computed as the sum of scores from questions 1-9 for PTSD and questions 1-3 & 7-10 for Acute Stress. Note: If 3 or more items are left unanswered, the total score on the scale is not calculated. If 1 or 2 items are left unanswered, a prorated score is calculated by summing the scores of items that were answered to get a partial raw score, multiplying the partial raw score by the total number of items (i.e., 9 on NSESSS-PTSD and 7 on NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder), and dividing the value by the number of items that were actually answered, rounded to the nearest whole number.

### EPDS

The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (<a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/Postnatal%20Depression%20Scale.pdf">EPDS</a>), a sensitive, 10-item screening tool for prenatal and postpartum depression symptoms, was selected to capture symptoms of prenatal and postnatal depression due to its ease of administration and widely accepted use. Responses are scored 0, 1, 2, or 3, and responses to items are summed for a total score. Note that items 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are reverse scored (i.e., 3, 2, 1, 0). For HBCD, the response option ‘Decline to answer’ was added to all questions. The response option ‘Don’t know’ was also included at the beginning of data collection, but was subsequently removed. Note that this does not impact scoring as questions answered with ‘Decline to answer’ or ‘Don’t know’ are skipped and marked as missing. Note that total scores are not prorated or left missing for missing items and data users should determine how best to address missing data. In addition, scores for EPDS self-harm (score>1) and depression (total score>11) triggered clinical alerts for study staff.

**Questionnaire prompt/instructions:**     
*Since you are either pregnant or have recently had a baby, we want to know how you feel. MARK the answer that comes closest to how you have felt IN THE PAST 7 DAYS-not just how you feel today.*

*In the past 7 days…*

<p>Implicit in responsible stewardship of prenatal drug exposure data is the recognition of the structural racism in which drug policy in the United States has long been embedded (Coles 1993; Wakeman et al., 2022). Responsible use of prenatal drug exposure data also requires thoughtful interpretation of exposure-related outcomes in the context of measured and unmeasured confounders. These confounders include, but are not limited to, phenotypic risks associated with persistent alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use during pregnancy by birthing parents (Massey et al., 2011), and confounding by familial risk from within-family studies (Estabrook et al., 2016).</p>
<p>Finally, unwarranted speculation about ‘neural bases of behavior’ form differences in neuroimaging between exposed and unexposed children in the absence of differences in behavioral performance can exacerbate stigma already faced by birthing parents with substance use disorders and their children (McAllister & Hart 2015).</p>

<p>It was difficult for some participants to self-report the typical size of a single drink (in oz) to capture ‘standard drinks’ of alcohol for Assist, leading to some reports falling outside the expected range. Similarly, reporting the frequency of use for substances like electronic cigarette devices proved difficult, resulting in outliers. While sites were queried on these outliers, participants could not always be re-contacted for clarification.</p> 
</div>
</p>

The Assist V1, V2, and V3 measures combine questions from the Family History Assessment Module (FHAM) and the All of Us Personal and Family Health History, which was then modified from the [NIDA Quick Screen (Modified Assist)](https://nida.nih.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/nmassist.pdf). The original quick screen was scored; however, our version is not scored. To acknowledge these changes in future publications, authors can note that questions were motivated from the NIDA Modified Assist.

The NIDA quick screen tool (*have you used alcohol, tobacco, prescription drugs, or illegal drugs in the last year*) was removed and replaced by questions to assess more details regarding types of substances used and the timeline of use before and during pregnancy. 

In addition, for lifetime and problematic use, and use pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, end-pregnancy, post-pregnancy, and past 3 months, use was expanded into the substances listed below for HBCD. For each substance, participants indicate whether they had ever used it and, if endorsed, frequency of use with options: 0 (Never), 1 (Once or Twice), 2 (Monthly), 3 (Weekly), or 4 (Daily or Almost Daily). For substances reported as used pre-pregnancy, during pregnancy, and end-pregnancy, participants were asked about modes of use and typical quantities/amounts of consumption for alcohol and opioids (if applicable). 

Finally, the Time Line Follow Back (TLFB) was triggered when substance use was reported before [pre-use] or during pregnancy [during_use] on the Assist V1 or at the end of pregnancy [end_use] on the ASSIST V2 (see documentation on TLFB).

<p>HBCD was designed to enable the characterization of the known fluctuation in substance use across the perinatal period critical for advancing prevention and intervention (Massey et al., 2023, Bandoli et al., 2022, Si et al., 2024).</p>
<p>Moreover, characterization of between- and within-person variability in substance use has been shown to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of risk prediction (Massey et al., 2021, Massey et al., 2018). Thus, the characterization of patterns or trajectories of use should be considered over the use of dichotomous exposure characterization. Another gap in literature concerns the extent, nature, and implications of polysubstance use during pregnancy since individual substances have primarily been examined alone in prior research (Massey et al., 2018). The power and scope of HBCD avails a unique opportunity to understand the prevalence and implications of such ‘real world’ patterns of substance use.</p>

<div class="warning-collapsible-content">
<p>The sampling covers specific weeks before pregnancy (Weeks 1-2) and during pregnancy (Weeks 3-9). Consequently, substance use reported outside these weeks may not appear in the TLFB, and a positive biospecimen may lack corresponding TLFB data for the same reason. This sampling approach balances participant burden (avoiding a full 40-week TLFB) with capturing key pregnancy phases when behaviors often shift, such as before and after pregnancy recognition and in late pregnancy.</p>
<p>Also, of note- participants were asked to report occasions (except cigarettes/cigarillos and drinks, reported as number), but some substances (e.g. electronic cigarette devices) are difficult to report in occasions and have outliers.</p>

The [original Timeline Follow Back](https://cde.nida.nih.gov/sites/nida_cde/files/TimeLineFollowBack_2014Mar24.pdf) is designed to cover the previous 7 days from when the survey is administered. The [HBCD TLFB](https://cde.nida.nih.gov/sites/nida_cde/files/TimeLineFollowBack_2014Mar24.pdf), triggered by responses on the ASSIST, was adapted to record substance use before and during pregnancy.

Participants reported use during 9 weeks in total for each substance type reported on the ASSIST (e.g., edible cannabis). For V01, this includes: pre-pregnancy use (Weeks 1-2: four weeks to two weeks before LMP), early pregnancy use (Weeks 3-6: two to six weeks after LMP), and current use (Week 7: the week prior to V1). The TLFB was repeated at V02 to capture substance use during the last two full weeks of gestation (Weeks 8-9). Daily usage frequency was recorded for all products except for cigarettes/cigarillos (count per day) and alcohol (single servings per day).
