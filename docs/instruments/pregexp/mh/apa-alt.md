## Instrument Details

The HBCD mental health screening instrument is based on an adapted version of the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 and Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures—Adult (APA 1/2). It combines the [Level 1 Measure](https://www.psychiatry.org/getmedia/e0b4b299-95b3-407b-b8c2-caa871ca218d/APA-DSM5TR-Level1MeasureAdult.pdf) with selected [Level 2 measures]((https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/educational-resources/assessment-measures), with several modifications to align with the study population and other instruments used in HBCD.

**Level 1** includes one to 1-2 for each of **12 mental health conditions**. When symptoms were reported for Level 1, the participant answered several subsequent questions, which asked about **additional symptoms** associated with each mental health condition (e.g. anxiety - **see full list**), including anger, anxiety, depression, mania, repetitive thoughts, somatic symptoms and sleep problems. 

Slight modifications were made due to the use of other measures and the study population, including:

- Level 1 questions for substance use were not included for HBCD.
- Participants proceed automatically to level 2 measures for personality inventory.
- All participants answer the level 1 questions on depression and somatic symptoms, but proceed to level 2 questions irrespective of answers.

**Level 2** measures include all [Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/educational-resources/assessment-measures) with the exception of Substance Abuse. The Level 2 measures for Depression and Sleep Disturbance were replaced with the **PROMIS Short Forms v1.0** [Depression 8a questionnaire](https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/toolkit_content/supplemental_info/psychiatric/measures/07_Depressed_Mood.doc) and [Sleep Disturbance 8a](https://heal.nih.gov/files/CDEs/2024-07/promis-sleep-disturbance-8a-crf.pdf). Documentation for each measure and its scoring can be found [here](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/educational-resources/assessment-measures). PROMIS scoring procedures for Depression can be found [here](https://www.healthmeasures.net/images/PROMIS/manuals/Scoring_Manual_Only/PROMIS_Depression_Scoring_Manual_05Dec2023.pdf) and for Sleep Disturbance can be found [here](https://www.healthmeasures.net/images/PROMIS/manuals/Scoring_Manual_Only/PROMIS_Sleep_Scoring_Manual.pdf).

Finally, the HBCD measure also integrates the [Personality Inventory for DSM-5 Brief](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_The-Personality-Inventory-For-DSM-5-Brief-Form-Adult.pdf), which assesses five personality trait domains including negative affect, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition, and psychoticism. Scoring for the Personality Inventory can be found [here](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_The-Personality-Inventory-For-DSM-5-Brief-Form-Adult.pdf).

Additional modifications are described below. Future publications should be sure to acknowledge the removal of Level 1 and 2 substance use and the gating mechanisms for somatic symptoms and personality inventory:

<p style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>Excluded Questions and Gating</b></p>
<p>This mental health screening instrument has two levels. Level 1 includes one to two questions for each of thirteen mental health conditions. When symptoms were reported for Level 1, the participant answered several subsequent questions, which asked about additional symptoms associated with each mental health condition, including anger, anxiety, depression, mania, repetitive thoughts, somatic symptoms and sleep problems. Slight modifications were made due to the use of other measures and the study population. Specifically, the level 1 questions for substance use were not included. Also, participants proceed automatically to level 2 measures for personality inventory. In addition, all participants answer the level 1 questions on depression and somatic symptoms but proceed to level 2 questions irrespective of answers.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>Clinical Alerts</b></p>
<p>For HBCD, this measure was modified to alert study staff if responses to the Level 1 APA self-harm question ('Thoughts of actually hurting yourself?') or Level 2 APA depression questionnaire (items from 'I felt worthless' to 'I felt that nothing could cheer me up') exceed thresholds of 0 and 32, respectively.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>Response Option Changes</b></p>
<p>For HBCD, the response option ‘Decline to answer’ was added to all questions. The response option ‘Don’t know’ was also included at the beginning of data collection, but was subsequently removed. Note that this does not impact scoring as questions answered with ‘Decline to answer’ or ‘Don’t know’ are skipped and marked as missing.</p> 

<p>Note that in early data releases, total scores are not calculated for Level 2 measures. Users are encouraged to score individual scales themselves according to the scoring procedures linked above.</p>
