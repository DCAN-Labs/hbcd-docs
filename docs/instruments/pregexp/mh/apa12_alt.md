## Instrument Details

The HBCD mental health screening instrument is based on an adapted version of the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 and Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures—Adult (APA 1/2), combining items from the following:

- **Level 1**: [DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure—Adult](https://www.psychiatry.org/getmedia/e0b4b299-95b3-407b-b8c2-caa871ca218d/APA-DSM5TR-Level1MeasureAdult.pdf)
- **Level 2**: [DSM-5 Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/educational-resources/assessment-measures)

**Level 1** includes 1 - 2 questions for each of <span class="tooltip">13 mental health conditions<span class="tooltiptext">depression, anger, mania, anxiety, somatic symptoms, suicidal ideation, psychosis, sleep disturbance, memory, repetitive behaviors, dissociation, personality functioning (substance use was excluded)</span></span>. When symptoms were reported for Level 1, the participant answered several subsequent questions about <span class="tooltip">additional symptoms<span class="tooltiptext">including anger, anxiety, depression, mania, repetitive thoughts, somatic symptoms and sleep problems</span></span> associated with each mental health condition.

Slight modifications were made due to the use of other measures and the study population, including:

- Level 1 questions for substance use were not included as this is measured by other instruments in the HBCD study
- Participants proceed automatically to level 2 measures for personality inventory
- All participants answer the level 1 questions on depression and somatic symptoms, but proceed to level 2 questions irrespective of answers
- **Level 2** measures for Depression and Sleep Disturbance were replaced with the **PROMIS Short Forms v1.0** [Depression 8a questionnaire](https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/toolkit_content/supplemental_info/psychiatric/measures/07_Depressed_Mood.doc) and [Sleep Disturbance 8a](https://heal.nih.gov/files/CDEs/2024-07/promis-sleep-disturbance-8a-crf.pdf)
- The HBCD measure also integrates the [Personality Inventory for DSM-5 Brief](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_The-Personality-Inventory-For-DSM-5-Brief-Form-Adult.pdf), which assesses five personality trait domains including negative affect, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition, and psychoticism 

Additional modifications are described below. Future publications should be sure to acknowledge the removal of Level 1 and 2 substance use and the gating mechanisms for somatic symptoms and personality inventory.

<p style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>Clinical Alerts</b></p>
<p>For HBCD, this measure was modified to alert study staff if responses to the Level 1 APA self-harm question ('Thoughts of actually hurting yourself?') or Level 2 APA depression questionnaire (items from 'I felt worthless' to 'I felt that nothing could cheer me up') exceed thresholds of 0 and 32, respectively.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>Response Option Changes</b></p>
<p>For HBCD, the response option ‘Decline to answer’ was added to all questions. The response option ‘Don’t know’ was also included at the beginning of data collection, but was subsequently removed. Note that this does not impact scoring as questions answered with ‘Decline to answer’ or ‘Don’t know’ are skipped and marked as missing.</p> 
<p>Note that in early data releases, total scores are not calculated for Level 2 measures. Users are encouraged to score individual scales themselves according to the scoring procedures linked above.</p>
