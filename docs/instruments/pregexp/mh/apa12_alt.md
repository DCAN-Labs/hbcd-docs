<p style="margin-bottom: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px; border-bottom: 1px solid #6b6b6b66;"><strong>Consideration of Mental Health Symptoms Experienced During Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>Concurrence of psychiatric symptoms and substance use is well-recognized during pregnancy (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1521-0391.2010.00110.x">Massey et al., 2011</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2012.04.002">Massey et al., 2012</a>). Phenotypic risk in birthing parents may influence neurodevelopmental outcomes via prenatal and postnatal influences other than direct exposures alone (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10519-015-9762-2">Estabrook et al., 2016</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ntt.2015.11.010">Massey et al., 2016</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ntt.2018.02.003">Massey et al., 2018</a>). These influences may confound exposure-related neuroimaging and neurodevelopmental findings, and also represent malleable targets for prevention and early intervention. Thus, consideration of mental health symptoms experienced by birthing parents as covariates is strongly encouraged when possible to address these confounds.</p>

## Instrument Details

The HBCD mental health screening instrument is a highly sensitive screening tool for use in community samples. It has two levels, adapted from DSM-5 Self-Rated [Level 1](https://www.psychiatry.org/getmedia/e0b4b299-95b3-407b-b8c2-caa871ca218d/APA-DSM5TR-Level1MeasureAdult.pdf) and [Level 2](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/educational-resources/assessment-measures) (version 8a) Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures.

**Level 1** includes 1 - 2 questions for each of <span class="tooltip">11 mental health conditions<span class="tooltiptext">depression, anger, mania, anxiety, somatic symptoms, suicidal ideation, psychosis, sleep disturbance, memory, repetitive behaviors, dissociation</span></span>. This excludes *personality functioning* and *substance use* present in the original measure (SU is captured by a separate set of instruments for HBCD - see measures listed [here](../../index.md#pregexp)). When symptoms were reported for Level 1, participants are subsequently administered the corresponding **Level 2** <span class="tooltip">Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures<span class="tooltiptext">including anger, anxiety, depression, mania, repetitive thoughts, somatic symptoms, and sleep problems</span></span> associated with each mental health condition (with the exception of substance use). For HBCD, symptom measures for *depression* and *sleep disturbance* were replaced with the *PROMIS Short Forms v1.0* [Depression 8a questionnaire](https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/toolkit_content/supplemental_info/psychiatric/measures/07_Depressed_Mood.doc) and [Sleep Disturbance 8a](https://heal.nih.gov/files/CDEs/2024-07/promis-sleep-disturbance-8a-crf.pdf). Level 2 additionally includes the [Personality Inventory for DSM-5 Brief](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_The-Personality-Inventory-For-DSM-5-Brief-Form-Adult.pdf), which assesses five personality trait domains, including negative affect, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition, and psychoticism.

Gating was adapted for the HBCD study population so that participants proceed automatically to Level 2 measures for personality inventory. In addition, all participants answer the Level 1 questions on depression and somatic symptoms, but proceed to Level 2 questions irrespective of answers. Future publications should be sure to acknowledge the removal of Level 1 and 2 substance use and the gating mechanisms for personality inventory and somatic symptoms.

<p><b>Clinical Alerts</b><br>
This measure was modified to alert HBCD study staff if responses to the Level 1 APA self-harm question ('Thoughts of actually hurting yourself?') or Level 2 APA depression questionnaire (items from 'I felt worthless' to 'I felt that nothing could cheer me up') exceed thresholds of 0 and 32, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Response Option Changes</b>
For HBCD, the response option ‘Decline to answer’ was added to all questions. The response option ‘Don’t know’ was also included at the beginning of data collection, but was subsequently removed. This does not impact scoring, as questions answered with ‘Decline to answer’ or ‘Don’t know’ are skipped and marked as missing.</p>
