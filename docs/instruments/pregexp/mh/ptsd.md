<p>Concurrence of psychiatric symptoms and substance use is well-recognized during pregnancy (Massey et al., 2011, 2012). Phenotypic risk in birthing parents may influence neurodevelopmental outcomes via prenatal and postnatal influences other than direct exposures alone (Estabrook et al., 2016, Massey et al., 2016, Massey et al., 2018). These influences may confound exposure-related neuroimaging and neurodevelopmental findings, and also represent malleable targets for prevention and early intervention. Thus, consideration of mental health symptoms experienced by birthing parents as covariates is strongly encouraged when possibl to address these confounds.</p>

## Instrument Details
The HBCD Severity of Posttraumatic/Acute Stress Symptoms measure was developed to assess the severity of PTSD and acute stress symptoms following a traumatic event (for individuals aged 18 and older). It combines items from two surveys from the National Stressful Events Surveys: items 1-9 from the PTSD Short Scale ([NSESSS-PTSD](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Posttraumatic-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf)) and item 3 from the Acute Stress Disorder Short Scale ([NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Acute-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf)) into a single 10-item assessment for the HBCD study.  Responses are scored 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 and responses to items are summed for a total score. For HBCD, the response option ‘Decline to answer’ was added to all questions. The response option ‘Don’t know’ was also included at the beginning of data collection, but was subsequently removed. Future publications should note that this measure combines NSESSS-PTSD and NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder.

**Questionnaire prompt/instructions:**    
*People sometimes have problems after extremely stressful events or experiences. How much have you been bothered during the PAST SEVEN (7) DAYS by each of the following problems that occurred or became worse after an extremely stressful event/experience?*

<p>Scores on these scales assess trauma-related stress symptoms and do not differentiate between PTSD and Acute Stress Disorder. Researchers should review individual items on each scale to determine the most relevant scale to their research. Individual total scores are provided for NSESSS-PTSD and NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder, and are computed as the sum of scores from questions 1-9 for PTSD and questions 1-3 & 7-10 for Acute Stress. Note: If 3 or more items are left unanswered, the total score on the scale is not calculated. If 1 or 2 items are left unanswered, a prorated score is calculated by summing the scores of items that were answered to get a partial raw score, multiplying the partial raw score by the total number of items (i.e., 9 on NSESSS-PTSD and 7 on NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder), and dividing the value by the number of items that were actually answered, rounded to the nearest whole number.</p>
