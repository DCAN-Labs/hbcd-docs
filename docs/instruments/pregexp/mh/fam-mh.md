## Instrument Details

The **HBCD FAM MH** assesses self-reported diagnoses and mental health conditions of the biological mother, biological father, and biological maternal and paternal grandmother and grandfather. It was created from combining and modifying items from the following instruments:

1. **Family History Assessment Module ([FHAM](https://arc.psych.wisc.edu/self-report/family-history-assessment-module-fham/))** items:
    - alcohol use [alc]
    - drug use [drug]
    - depression [dep]
    - mania [man]
    - Schizophrenia [sch]
2. **All of Us Personal and Family Health History ([All of Us](https://www.researchallofus.org/wp-content/themes/research-hub-wordpress-theme/media/2023/PaFHH_Survey_English.pdf))** mental health outcomes for only biological mother [bm] and biological father [bf], excluding questions about age of diagnosis, treatment, and medications: 
    - Alcohol Use Disorder [001]
    - Anxiety disorder or panic disorder [002]
    - Autism Spectrum Disorder [003]
    - Bipolar disorder [004]
    - Depressive disorder [005]
    - Drug or Substance Use Disorder [006]
    - Schizophrenia [007]
    - Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) [008]

Future publications should note that this measure is a combination of these and that this is not a scored scale, but simply descriptive for family psychiatric history.
