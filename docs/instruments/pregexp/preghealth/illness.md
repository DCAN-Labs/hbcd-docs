<p>Subject matter experts note that there are potential issues relating to correct coding for (1) ICD codes from BioPortal ICD (used to capture reason(s) for medication use, ER visits, and hospitalizations) and (2) symptom codes from World Health Organization. For instruments utilizing these coding systems, it was at times difficult for the participant to name or HBCD Study team member conducting the survey to find the correct code/name in a databases.</p> 
<p>For Pregnancy Health-Illness, coding difficulty was noted for use of the ER for normal care (no diagnosis) or false alarms (e.g. thought water broke but it did not), resulting in the use of ‘don’t know.’</p>
