## Instrument Details

The HBCD FAM MH assesses self-reported diagnoses and mental health conditions of the biological mother, biological father, and biological maternal and paternal grandmother and grandfather. It was created from combining and modifying items from the [Family History Assessment Module (FHAM)](https://arc.psych.wisc.edu/self-report/family-history-assessment-module-fham/) and the [All of Us Personal and Family Health History](https://www.researchallofus.org/wp-content/themes/research-hub-wordpress-theme/media/2023/PaFHH_Survey_English.pdf). The HBCD FAM MH includes (1) FHAM items on alcohol use [alc], drug use [drug], depression [dep], mania [man], and Schizophrenia [sch]; and (2) All of Us mental health outcomes for only biological mother [bm] and biological father [bf]: Alcohol Use Disorder [001], Anxiety disorder or panic disorder [002], Autism Spectrum Disorder [003], Bipolar disorder [004], Depressive disorder [005], Drug or Substance Use Disorder [006], Schizophrenia [007], and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) [008], excluding questions about age of diagnosis, treatment, and medications. Future publications should note that this measure is a combination of these and that this is not a scored scale, but simply descriptive for family psychiatric history.
