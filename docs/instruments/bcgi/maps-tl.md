<td style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: normal;">QC procedures involved examination of missingness (by counting the number of items answered for each participant) and age to ensure that it falls within the expected range of 3-9 months. Summary statistics and visualizations were generated to review item-level frequencies, age, and scores (calculated with application of prorated scoring to account for missing data). Finally, Cronbach's Alpha was calculated to assess reliability. Common errors noted during QC include incorrect administration ages and prorated scoring not being accurately applied to observations with missing responses.</td></tr>

## Instrument Details

Multidimensional Assessment Profiles- Temper Loss scale (MAPS-TL) is a well-validated survey assessing irritability that serves as a tool for characterizing the developmental expression of early mental health risk. MAPS-TL measures a range of behaviors that encompass dysregulation, responsiveness to environmental input, and context. Questions inquire about the behaviors of the focal child over the past month. Irritability has been identified as an early dimensional marker of lifespan mental health risk. MAPS-TL aims to delineate the typical-to-atypical spectrum of irritability in early childhood and identify those young children at high probability of subsequent adaptational problems based on problems with dysregulation.

<p>Alterations were made for use of gender-neutral terms and “parent” was replaced with “parent/caregiver” where appropriate. Because the psychometric validation for these measures was done using items from the original measures, future publications should account for and note edits made to individual items.</p>

<p>Each of the 17 items for MAPS-TL is answered on a scale of 1 to 6: 1 [Never], 2 [Rarely (Less than once per week)], 3 [Some (1-3) days of the week], 4 [Most (4-6) days of the week], 5 [Every day of the week], 6 [Many times each day]. A **sum score** is generated when the caregiver provides a numerical score of 1 to 6 for at least 9 out of the 17 items. If fewer than 9 items are completed, the score is marked as missing. When responses are available for 9 to 16 items, a prorated score is calculated using the formula: <code>(sum of items answered / number of items answered) * 17</code>.</p>
