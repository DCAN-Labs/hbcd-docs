<td style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: normal;">QC procedures involved examination of missingness (by counting the number of items answered for each participant) and age to ensure that it falls within an expected range of 3-9 months. Summary statistics and visualizations were generated to review item-level frequencies, age, and scores (calculated with application of prorated scoring to account for missing data). Finally, Cronbach's Alpha was calculated to assess reliability. Common errors noted during QC include incorrect administration ages and prorated scoring not being accurately applied to observations with missing responses.</td></tr>

## Instrument Details

The ecPROMIS (Early Childhood Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System) offers clinicians and researchers a brief, efficient, and precise way to evaluate young children’s well-being. One component is the Child-Caregiver Relationship Scale, which assesses the degree to which young children develop close, satisfying relationships with caregivers. The **ecPROMIS Child-Caregiver Relationship Form (Infancy: < 1 year)** was developed for HBCD based on this scale (specifically the ecPROMIS Parent-Report Short Form v1.0 - Social Relationships – Child-Caregiver Interactions 5a Form) with updated language to make the items suitable for the pre-V03 age range (3 to 9 months) (i.e. the term ‘my child’ was replaced with 'my baby,' per the guidance of ecPROMIS developers, as the original measure was designed for 1-5 year old children).

Alterations were additionally made to ecPROMIS for use of gender-neutral terms. Measure instructions and individuals items that reference gendered pronouns (‘her/him’, ‘she/he’) were changed to “my/the baby/child” or “they/them” as fit for the wording. In addition, “parent” was replaced with “parent/caregiver” where appropriate. Because the psychometric validation for these measures was done using items from the original measures, future publications should account for and note edits made to individual items.
