# Faces Task

**Full Name**: Faces Task       
**Acronym**: FACE          
**Table Name**: **TO DO**     

The Faces task (v.11.29.23) is used to assess neural activity supporting face and object processing within the first years of life. Event-related potentials (ERPs) are recorded while infants view faces and objects using an oddball task designed to index different stages of processing including attention, perception, categorization, individuation, and memory. 

## Task Details   
ERPs that index different stages of processing are computed as a function of repeated presentation of faces and objects. The ERP components elicited by the Faces task include P1, N290, and P400.

The task consists of 2 blocks:
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Block 1</strong>: 50 trials of upright faces and 50 trials of inverted faces <br />
  <strong>Block 2</strong>: 50 trials of upright faces and 50 trials of objects</p>
</blockquote>

Timing Details:
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Stimulus duration</strong>: 500 ms <br />
  <strong>Interstimulus interval</strong>: 600-700 ms <br />
  <strong>Total trial length</strong>: 110-1200 ms</p>
</blockquote>

If the child loses attention, an attention getter may be played to bring the childâ€™s focus back to the task. There are a total of 36 unique images in the set, with women all displaying neutral expressions, included from each of the following self-identifying demographics: Indigenous, Black, White, Asian, Hispanic/Latino, and South Asian.
