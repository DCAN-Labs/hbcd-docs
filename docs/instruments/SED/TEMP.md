## Implementation & Data Collection
With the exception of PROMIS, all surveys, filled out by the parent, are child-unspecific. When in-person, surveys were administered by HBCD research associates. Surveys were translated to Spanish for HBCD by [BURG Translations](https://burgtranslations.com/our-services/). Additional information is as follows:

## Quality Control

For the majority of instruments, the data dashboard was monitored for variable missingness, possible coding errors, scoring verification when needed, and data consistency 


## Instrument Details


### Perceived Stress/Social Support
The Perceived Stress and Social Support tools assess caregivers’ perceived stress and emotional support within their social networks longitudinally. These tools combine the PROMIS Emotional Support 4a questionnaire and the Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS-4).

The PROMIS Emotional Support 4a questionnaire (first 4 questions) evaluates the quality of emotional support available to the participant, while the PSS-4 (last 4 questions) measures general perceived stress over the past month. The PSS-4 is a shortened version of the PSS-14, which has been widely used across diverse populations, including pregnant individuals and young families.

Note that the HBCD measures include the addition of response options “Don’t know” and “Decline to answer.” The original measure requires that all items are completed to allow for scoring via the tables provided in the manual, so items with “don’t know” answers will not have a total score reported. If scoring will utilize the PROMIS HealthMeasures Scoring Service, total scores can include missing data (this can be done by individual investigators). For the PSS-4, complete data is essential, and scores should not be reported if any question is answered as “Don’t know.”
