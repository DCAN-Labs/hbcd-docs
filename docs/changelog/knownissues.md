<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 0px;"><u>Quantitative MRI</u></p>
Current estimated quantitative T1 values vary across the three MRI vendors and age. Furthermore, estimates do not align well with prior literature and may result from certain assumptions in the modeling procedures. Until this is resolved, the quantitative T1 (and consequently the PD) values will not be included in the release data. See additional notes [here](../measures/mri/qmri.md#warning).
