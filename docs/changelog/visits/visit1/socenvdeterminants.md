<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Scoring Changes</u></b></p>
For the *Everyday Discrimination Scale* and *Major Experiences of Discrimination*, the Follow-up Question ("What do you think is the main reason for these experiences?") was asked once after both were complete to capture the main reasons for any items marked “a few times a year” (*Everyday Discrimination Scale*) or “yes” (*Major Experiences of Discrimination*). The original logic asked this question at the end of each individual scale.

## eHITS

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Global Measure Changes</u></b></p>
Various research groups made minor word changes. Sherin and colleagues developed the original instrument, HITS, published in 1998. Chan and colleagues expanded HITS to include a question regarding forced sexual activity (eHITS) ([Chan et al. 2010](https://doi.org/10.1177/102490791001700202)).

To acknowledged these changes in future publications, the WG recommends that investigators who analyze data generated by eHITS during HBCD include the exact verbiage of the HBCD-version of the item in the methods section of any reports, presentations, and manuscripts.

<!-- ASSESSMENT ITEM CHANGES -->
<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Instruction/Assessment Item Modifications</u></b></p>
The following outlines the differences in the wording and/or content of questions asked in the prior iterations of eHITS compared to HBCD. **Note that this first row contains the preceding text for all questions in rows following.

**Scoring procedures:**     
The eHITS summary score (sum of item ratings) is used clinically as a screening tool for intimate partner violence (IPV) based on a certain threshold. For HBCD, a clinical alert for IPV is triggered when at least one of the following is true:

 - Summary Score > 7
 - Score for “…physically hurt you?” > 0
 - Score for “…forced you to engage in sexual activity?” > 0

If a respondent selects “Don’t know” for one or more questions, a clinical alert may not generate for a participant whose correct responses would result in a score sufficient to trigger an alert.

## Neighborhood Safety

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Answer/Response Option Changes</u></b></p>
Addition of “Don’t know” and “Decline to answer”.

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Scoring Changes</u></b></p>
The original measure was scored by averaging all three items. No scoring is used in HBCD - all responses are item-level only. 

<br>

--------------------------------------------------
## PACES
<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Instruction/Assessment Item Modifications</u></b></p>
The following language was updated:

- Original: "When answering these questions, think about the last 12 months. On a scale of 1 to 5, fill the circle of the number that best describes how often each of the items occurred."  
- HBCD: "When answering these questions, think about the last 12 months. Please select the response that best describes you."

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Answer/Response Option Changes</u></b></p>
“Declined to answer” added as a response.
<br>

--------------------------------------------------
## PROMIS

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Answer/Response Option Changes</u></b></p>
Addition of “Don’t know” and “Decline to answer”

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Scoring Changes</u></b></p>
Orignally, all items had to be completed to allow for scoring via the tables provided in the manual. For HBCD, this was updated so that items with “don’t know” answers will not have a total score reported.

For the PROMIS emotional support, complete data is necessary to use scoring tables provided in the manual. If scoring will utilize the PROMIS HealthMeasures Scoring Service, total scores can include missing data (this can be done by individual investigators). Complete data is always necessary to calculate a score PSS-4, therefore should not be reported for participants who answer any questions “don’t know.”
