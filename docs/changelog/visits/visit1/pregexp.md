# Mental Health [APA 1/2]
**S1 General Wording Changes & Impact on Interpretation of Results**

- Removed Level 1 gates from ‘personality functioning’ to go straight to Level 2 LEVEL 2—Repetitive Thoughts and Behaviors—Adult (adapted from the Florida Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory [FOCI] Severity Scale [Part B])
- Removed gates from ‘Somatic symptoms’ to go straight to ‘LEVEL 2—Somatic Symptom—Adult (Patient Health Questionnaire 15 Somatic Symptom Severity [PHQ-15])’
- Removed ‘substance use’ from Level 1-2 as its queried in other measures.

**How to Note in Publications**: It is recommended that these measure changes (removal of Level 1-2 substance use (section XIII) as well as gates for sections V (somatic) and XII (personality)) be noted in future publications. 

**S3 Detailed Answer/Response Option Changes**: The option ‘refuse to answer’ was added to all questions. Note that this does not impact scoring (questions answered with ‘refuse to answer’ are skipped).
