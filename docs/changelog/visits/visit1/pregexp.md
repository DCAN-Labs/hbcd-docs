# Pregnancy & Exposure

## Mental Health [APA 1/2]
<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Global Measure Changes</u></b></p>
<ul>
The APA 1/2 measure was modified in the following ways:
    <ul>
      <li>Removed Level 1 gates from ‘personality functioning’ to go straight to Level 2 LEVEL 2—Repetitive Thoughts and Behaviors—Adult (adapted from the Florida Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory [FOCI] Severity Scale [Part B])</li>
      <li>Removed gates from ‘Somatic symptoms’ to go straight to ‘LEVEL 2—Somatic Symptom—Adult (Patient Health Questionnaire 15 Somatic Symptom Severity [PHQ-15])’</li>
      <li>Removed ‘substance use’ from Level 1-2 as its queried in other measures</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
To acknowledged these changes in future publications: removal of Level 1-2 substance use (section XIII) as well as gates for sections V (somatic) and XII (personality) should be noted.

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Answer/Response Option Changes</u></b></p>
  The option ‘refuse to answer’ was added to all questions. Note that this does not impact scoring (questions answered with ‘refuse to answer’ are skipped).

## Substance Use [Assist V1]
<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Global Measure Changes</u></b></p>
This instrument was modified from the [NIDA Quick Screen (Modified Assist)](https://nida.nih.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/nmassist.pdf). The original quick screen was scored; however, our version is not scored. To acknowledged these changes in future publications: authors can note that questions were motivated from the NIDA Modified Assist.

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Instruction/Assessment Item Modifications</u></b></p>  
The NIDA quick screen tool (have you used alcohol, tobacco, prescription drugs, or illegal drugs in the last year) was removed and replaced by questions to assess more details regarding substances used and the timeline of their use before and during pregnancy. Please expand each section below to see specifics on added options/questions:

<div style="margin-bottom: 5px;">

## TLFB
<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Global Measure Changes</u></b></p>
The [original TLFB](https://cde.nida.nih.gov/sites/nida_cde/files/TimeLineFollowBack_2014Mar24.pdf) was modofied to meet the needs of the HBCD study. The original TLFB covers the last 7 days. For the HBCD study, the following timeframes are queried:

- Visit 1: LMP – 4 through LMP – 2, LMP + 2 through LMP + 6, Last week prior to V1 (enrollment)
- Visist 2: Last 2 full calendar weeks prior to delivery (to mask the child’s DOB)

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Answer/Response Option Changes</u></b></p>
For all substances except Alcohol, instead of getting Y/N per day, we ask number of times used/day (frequency of use).

<br>

------------------
## EPDS
<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Answer/Response Option Changes</u></b></p>
The option ‘refuse to answer’ was added to all questions. Note that this does not impact scoring (questions answered with ‘refuse to answer’ are skipped). 
<br>

--------------------------
## Personal and Family Psychiatric History [FAM MH]
<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Global Measure Changes</u></b></p>
This measure was created from combining and modifying the [Family History Assessment Module (FHAM)](https://arc.psych.wisc.edu/self-report/family-history-assessment-module-fham/) and the [All of Us Personal and Family Health History](https://www.researchallofus.org/wp-content/themes/research-hub-wordpress-theme/media/2023/PaFHH_Survey_English.pdf).

To acknowledged these changes in future publications, authors can note that questions were motivated from those measures, but this is not a scored scale; its simply descriptive for family history.

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Instruction/Assessment Item Modifications</u></b></p>
- Only selected alcohol-schizophrenia from FHAM; dropped ‘trouble with law’ and ‘nervous breakdown’.
- From all of us, we were only interested in a few mental health outcomes (AUD, anxiety, ASD, BPD, depression, SUD, schizophrenia and ADHD). Also, we were not interested in age of diagnosis or medications to treat.

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Answer/Response Option Changes</u></b></p>
- FHAM: response options (*originally parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, uncles, and cousins*) modified to include only biological mom, dad and grandparents 
- All of Us: response options (*originally mom, dad, sibling, daughter, son, and grandparent*) modified to include only biological mom and dad

## DSM5 PTSD
<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Global Measure Changes</u></b></p>
This measure is a combination of two measures: the [Severity of Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short scale](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Posttraumatic-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf) (questions 1-9) and the [Severity of Acute Stress Symptoms—Adult National Stressful Events Survey Acute Stress Disorder Short Scale (NSESSS)](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Acute-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf) 

The latter is a 7-item scale, 6 of which are overlapping from both scales, with one additional question unique to the Acute Stress scale. Thus, the scales are as follows:

- Total Raw Score Acute Stress (Total of Questions 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10)
- Total Raw Score PTSD (Total of Questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b><u>Scoring Changes</u></b></p>
We added ‘refuse to answer’, but not ‘don’t know.’ Scoring has always allowed skips when done on paper, and the authors are not specific for how to deal with that.
