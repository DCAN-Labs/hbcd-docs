<p>The HBCD Administrative Core (HCAC) and the HBCD Data Coordinating Center (HDCC) do not provide letters that could be interpreted as endorsements for specific applications or projects proposing secondary analyses of HBCD Study data. However, we are committed to fostering open communication with the broader scientific community. To support this, we can provide a letter outlining our commitment to facilitating access to information about the HBCD Data Resource, helping researchers obtain the details they need to pursue their specific aims. To request such a letter, please contact Lilly Tureaud at ltureaud@health.ucsd.edu.</p>

<p>All individuals can typically obtain their own data access, including graduate students, postdocs, and similar roles. However, it's ultimately up to your institution to decide whether they will co-sign an independent DUC.</p>
<p>Group-Level DUC is generally recommended, where principal investigators (PI) submit a single DUC that includes trainees, lab members, and collaborators (adding or removing users is managed via user dashboard). The lead investigator is responsible for ensuring that individuals added as part of a group-level DUC are in compliance with its terms and conditions. Note that it is essential for the primary DUC holder to renew annually, as expiration will result in access being revoked for all listed collaborators.</p>

<p>DUCs are not transferable between institutions.

<div class="notification-collapsible-content">
<br>
<p>It is prohibited to input HBCD data into generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) because doing so would violate the terms of the data use agreement. These agreements strictly limit access to approved individuals to protect sensitive information. Generative AI tools process input data in ways that may result in unauthorized access or unintended use, making them unsuitable for handling restricted data.</p>

  <span class="notification-arrow">▸</span>
</div>
<div class="notification-collapsible-content">
<br>
<p>HBCD image processing pipelines use field maps to perform distortion correction for structural and functional MRI data. Most researchers will likely use the processed data for their analyses and therefore do not need to use the fieldmaps for anything, as all pipeline output derivatives are already distortion corrected. However, if using the <a href="../datacuration/rawbids">raw BIDS data</a> for your research, note that each fMRI acquisition will have a specific pair of fieldmaps associated with it, acquired in AP and PA phase encoding directions, located under <code>fmap/</code>. The matching EPI fieldmaps can easily be identified by the run number, specified by <code>run-&lt;label&gt;</code> in the filename (see details <a href="../datacuration/rawbids/#functional-func-and-fieldmaps-fmap">here</a>).

<p>Imaging QC metrics are provided for each scan in the session-level <code>scans.tsv</code> file - see details about this file <a href="../datacuration/rawbids/#scan-level-data">here</a>. Automated QC metrics were generated for all data described under <a href="../measures/mri/qc">HBCD MR QC Procedures</a>. However, only a subset of series are selected for manual review based on the automated QC metrics. Therefore, not all scans will have both automated and manual QC metrics.</p>

<div class="notification-collapsible-content">
<br>
<p>Imaging data provided in the release only includes data that have passed quality control and additional compliancy checks. Please see a description of <a href="../datacuration/exclusions/#imaging">Exclusion Criteria</a> for details on metrics for inclusion in the data pool. All data provided in the release should therefore be of sufficient quality to include in analyses.</p>

<p>Note that all QC metrics derived from the <a href="../measures/mri/qc/#raw-mr-data-qc">raw data QC procedures</a> are included in the session-level <code>scans.tsv</code> file-see details <a href="../datacuration/rawbids/#participant-session-scan-level-data">here</a>. In addition, following QC, data curation, and BIDS conversion, raw structural and functional MRI data are additionally run through MRIQC to generate image quality metrics. See <a href="../datacuration/derivatives/#mriqc-mriqc">here</a> for an overview of the MRIQC derivatives provided. Researchers may use these outputs for additional curation if desired.</p>
<p>Finaly, several processing pipelines use the <code>scans.tsv</code> file to determine which input files to use - see the <a href="../processing/pipelines">overview of data processing</a> for details. In addition, for fMRI, dMRI, MRS, and EEG, the visual summary reports included in the pipeline derivatives can be inspected to inform the selection of which files to include/exclude in analyses (e.g. <code>sub-&lt;label&gt;_ses-&lt;label&gt;_executive_summary.html</code> report generated by <a href="../datacuration/derivatives/#xcp-d-xcpd_d">XCP-D</a>). Several modalities have undergone visual QC, many of which are based on these visual reports, via <a href="../measures/mri/qc/#brainswipes">BrainSwipes</a> as well, the outputs of which are also made available in the BIDS <a href="../datacuration/phenotypes">phenotype/</a> folder.</p>

  <span class="text">Why is the cerebellum sometimes cutoff in fMRI and dMRI that have passed QC?</span>
  <span class="notification-arrow">▸</span>
</div>
<div class="notification-collapsible-content">
<br>
<p>Due to the relatively limited brain coverage in dMRI and fMRI acquisitions, the superior or inferior edges of the brain may occasionally fall outside the slice stack, referred to as field of view (FOV) cutoff. In cases where the cutoff is extreme (>30% of the image), the dMRI and fMRI series fail QC and will have a value of 0 in the <code>QC</code> field of <code>scans.tsv</code> (see <a href="#faq-qcrec">this FAQ</a> for details). However, mild (<10%) to moderate (10–30%) FOV cutoff does not lead to QC failure. Brain regions outside of the FOV will have missing values in the tabulated imaging data, but the remaining areas remain usable. Automated post-processing QC metrics provide measurements of superior and inferior FOV cutoff, which researchers use for the exclusion of participants with significant FOV cutoff from analyses. See <a href="../measures/mri/qc/#hbcd-raw-mri-data-qc">HBCD Raw MRI Data QC</a> in the Release Notes for a description of automated and manual quality control procedures for raw imaging data.</p>

<p><b>Gestational age at administration</b> (<code>gestational_age</code>, reported in days): During the prenatal period, gestational age at administration (GAA) refers to the time elapsed between the jittered expected due date (EDD, used as a proxy for the time of conception, or the first day of the mother's last menstrual period) and the date of administration of the instrument. Note that GAA can be negative for instruments administered before the jittered EDD.</p> 
<p><b>Gestational age at birth</b> (<code>gestational_age_birth</code>, reported in days): After birth, the gestational age at birth (GAB) represents the time between conception and birth and remains constant.</p> 
<p><b>Candidate age</b> (<code>candidate_age</code>, reported in years with precision to 3 decimal places): The time elapsed between birth (based on a birthdate measure jittered up to 7 days) and the date of administration of the instrument. Note that V01 candidate age values are recorded as 'n/a' as this data pertains to the prenatal period.</p>
