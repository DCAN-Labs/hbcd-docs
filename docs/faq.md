<p>All individuals can typically obtain their own data access, including graduate students, postdocs, and similar roles. However, it's ultimately up to your institution to decide whether they will co-sign an independent DUC.</p>
<p>Group-Level DUC is generally recommended, where principal investigators (PI) submit a single DUC that includes trainees, lab members, and collaborators (adding or removing users is managed via user dashboard). The lead investigator is responsible for ensuring that individuals added as part of a group-level DUC are in compliance with its terms and conditions. Note that it is essential for the primary DUC holder to renew annually, as expiration will result in access being revoked for all listed collaborators.</p>

<p>DUCs are not transferable between institutions. If you have an individual DUC or are lead on a group-level DUC and move to a new institution, please email nbdc@mail.nih.gov to notify NBDC and submit a new DUC with appropriate sponsorship from the new institution to retain access. The lead investigator of a group-level DUC may also designate another lead investigator at their former institution as a replacement.</p>

</div>
<div class="notification-collapsible-content">
<br>
<p>It is prohibited to input HBCD data into generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) because doing so would violate the terms of the data use agreement. These agreements strictly limit access to approved individuals to protect sensitive information. Generative AI tools process input data in ways that may result in unauthorized access or unintended use, making them unsuitable for handling restricted data.</p>

<p>HBCD study protocols are available in the Scientist section of the main HBCD Study website <a href="https://hbcdstudy.org/study-protocols/">here</a>. However, please note that we are generally unable to share the specific measures used outside of the study, as many are proprietary. General information about the questions asked and corresponding answer options can be explored through our new interactive <a href="../datadictionary">Data Dictionary</a> and additional details/resources are available in measure descriptions provided in the section <a href="../measures/">Release Notes: Data Measures & Quality Control</a>.

    <span class="text">Why is the cerebellum sometimes cutoff in fMRI and dMRI?</span>
</span>
  <span class="notification-arrow">▸</span>
</div>
<div class="notification-collapsible-content">
<br>
<p>Raw QC excludes only images with major issues from further processing. Due to the relatively limited brain coverage in dMRI and fMRI acquisitions, the superior or inferior edges of the brain may occasionally fall outside the slice stack, referred to as field of view (FOV) cutoff. In cases where the cutoff is extreme (>30% of the image), the dMRI and fMRI series are excluded during raw QC. However, mild (<10%) to moderate (10–30%) FOV cutoff does not lead to exclusion. Brain regions outside of the FOV will have missing values in the tabulated imaging data, but the remaining areas remain usable. Automated post-processing QC metrics provide measurements of superior and inferior FOV cutoff, which researchers use for the exclusion of participants with significant FOV cutoff from analyses. See <a href="../measures/mri/qc/#hbcd-raw-mri-data-qc">HBCD Raw MRI Data QC</a> in the Release Notes for a description of automated and manual quality control procedures for raw imaging data.</p>

</span>
  <span class="notification-arrow">▸</span>
</div>
<div class="notification-collapsible-content">
<br>
<p>HBCD image processing pipelines use field maps to perform distortion correction for structural and functional MRI data. Most researchers will likely use the processed data for their analyses and therefore do not need to use the fieldmaps for anything, as all pipeline output derivatives are already distortion corrected. However, if using the <a href="../datacuration/imaging">raw BIDS data</a> for your research, note that each fMRI acquisition will have a specific pair of fieldmaps associated with it, acquired in AP and PA phase encoding directions, located under <code>fmap/</code>. The matching EPI fieldmaps can easily be identified by the run number, specified by <code>run-&lt;label&gt;</code> in the filename (see details <a href="../datacuration/imaging/#functional-func-and-fieldmaps-fmap">here</a>).

<p>Imaging QC metrics are provided for each scan in the session-level <code>scans.tsv</code> file - see details about this file <a href="../datacuration/imaging/#participant-session-scan-level-data">here</a>. Automated QC metrics were generated for all data described under <a href="../measures/mri/qc">HBCD MR QC Procedures</a>. However, only a subset of series are selected for manual review based on the automated QC metrics. Therefore, not all scans will have both automated and manual QC metrics.</p>

Please see <a href="../measures/mri/qc/#hbcd-raw-mri-data-qc">HBCD Raw MRI Data QC</a> for details. All QC metrics derived from the raw data QC procedures are included in the session-level <code>scans.tsv</code> file (described in detail under <a href="../datacuration/imaging">Raw BIDS Data</a>). Following QC, data curation, and BIDS conversion, raw structural and functional MRI data are additionally run through MRIQC to generate image quality metrics. See <a href="../datacuration/derivatives/#mriqc-mriqc">here</a> for an overview of the provided MRIQC derivatives. Researchers may use these outputs for additional curation if desired. For processed data, including fMRI, dMRI, MRS, and EEG, the summary reports included in the pipeline derivatives can be used to inform the selection of which files to include/exclude in analyses (see details <a href="../datacuration/derivatives">here</a>).</p>
