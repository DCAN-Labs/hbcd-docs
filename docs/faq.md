<p><i>Sourced directly from ABCD</i>: "In general, each person is able to get their own data access, but you may also list collaborators on a “Parent” DUC that then grants access to the data to all collaborators listed on the DUC. That said, it is up to your institution to determine whether they will “co-sign” an independent DUC for a student, though generally graduate students, postdocs, etc., have been able to have their own DUC. Some groups have the PI submit a DUC with trainees and other lab members listed as collaborators. If you go that route, then you just need to make sure the primary DUC holder doesn’t forget to renew their DUC annually, otherwise all others on the DUC will lose access along with them when it expires." </p>

    <span class="text">Where can I find the protocol for the HBCD study?</span>
  </span>
  <span class="notification-arrow">▸</span>
</div>
<div class="notification-collapsible-content">
<br>
<p>You can find our protocol on the scientist section of our website <a href="https://hbcdstudy.org/study-protocols/">here</a>, but in general we are not able to share the actual measures outside of the study, as many are proprietary. You can read a lot more about the protocol development in a special issue of DCN on the HBCD Study <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/special-issue/10VNSS1BBLV">here</a>. Finally, you can also generally find the questions asked and answer options as part of the protocol on our new interactive <a href="../datadictionary">Data Dictionary</a> and find more information on the <a href="../">HBCD Data Release webpage</a>.</p>
