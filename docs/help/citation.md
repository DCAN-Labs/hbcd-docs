# How To Cite HBCD Data Release Docs

The HBCD Data Release Docs is version-controlled and enables researchers to both cite and render specific versions of the website. We highly recommend citing the specific version from which you obtained information as the documentation will be updated over time. To cite the current version of the Docs site, go to the publication on Zenodo ([https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15002829](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15002829)) and copy the citation provided under **Citation** in the right side of the page:

<img src="../../images/zenodo.png" alt="Citation" width="30%" height="auto" class="center">

Note that previous versions of the Release Docs website can be viewed by selecting a version from the flyout menu in the bottom-right corner of the page:

<div class="img-with-text">
    <img src="../../images/flyout-addons.webp" alt="Opened flyout menu example image from ReadTheDocs" width="30%" height="auto" class="center">
    <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Opened flyout menu example (source: ReadtheDocs)</i></p>
</div>
