# DEAP Data Dictionary Explorer

We provide a Data Dictionary Explorer hosted by the Data Exploration and Analysis Portal (DEAP) open to users who do not yet have data access.

The data dictionary explorer has two main pages:

The **Variable Selection** page allows users to explore the ontology of data tables, i.e., their hierarchical organization into domains and subdomains, as well as the data dictionary, i.e., how variables are grouped into different tables, in an interactive manner and provides extensive filter and search capabilities. Users can select variables and add them to a selection of variables of interest.

The **Manage Selections and Downloads** page allows users to manage their selection of variables and download a data dictionary containing just these variables. (This application does not allow to download the data itself. Users with a valid data use certificate can download the data through Lasso).
