## Responsible Use & Expert Review Warnings
To promote responsible use of the data and offer additional context for users, warnings are displayed at the top of each measure/instrument section as necessary. These warnings are incorporated in both the [Dictionary Query Tool on Lasso](../data_access/querytool.md) and [Data Dictionary Explorer](../data_access/datadictionary.md) to link directly to the release notes for relevant Variable or Table warnings. We encourage all data users to examine the warnings for any variables you plan to download/utilize and adhere to the recommended guidelines. 

**For consistency with [ABCD study data release](https://data.abcdstudy.org/reports/wiki-release6/) also hosted on the NBDC Lasso platform, Responsible Data Use Warnings for overlapping measures were provided by the ABCD Wiki (see additional information [here](https://data.abcdstudy.org/reports/wiki-release6/jedi.html#warnings-in-release-noteswiki)). These warnings are clearly labeled as such and contain a direct link to the Wiki source, as is demonstrated in the example and explanation below.** 

There are two types of warnings:

<p>The Expert Review warnings offer critical guidance from subject matter experts, tailored specifically to the context of HBCD measures and data. These warnings address considerations and recommendations for measure usage, highlight known issues, and provide important reminders. Additionally, they include detailed instructions and/or code to assist researchers with various aspects of data use, such as working with datasets, calculating variables, or performing specific analyses. This information is designed to enhance transparency, promote best practices, and streamline the use of each measure or data type.</p>
