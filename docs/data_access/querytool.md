# Dictionary Query Tool

**Step 1: Get Started with Approved Access**  
Once your **Data Use Certification** has been approved and you’ve completed the required training, you’ll gain access to the **Query Data** tab in Lasso. This tab is conveniently located in the **left-hand side menu**.

**Step 2: Choose Your Query Method**  
On the Query Data page, you can toggle between the **Query Wizard** and the **Dictionary Query Tool**. Both tools offer flexible ways to build your queries, letting you choose the approach that best suits your needs.
