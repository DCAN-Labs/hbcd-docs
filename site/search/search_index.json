This file provides details on the various sessions acquired for the participant, including the collection site, the participant\u2019s age and gestational age at each session, and head size. Descriptions of the TSV column names and the properties of their values are available in the accompanying sessions.json sidecar file. Note: age measures are computed based on a birthdate measure that is jittered up to 7 days. Scan-Level Data The complexity of data acquisition and the varying image quality across scans make the scans.tsv file, located in the session folder. This file contains information about how old the participant was at the time of the acquisition, and in certain cases there is also information about the quality of the underlying acquisition. To get a better understanding of what the different fields in the scans.tsv file mean, please refer to the scans.json file.

The raw QC process involves reviewing unprocessed or lightly processed MRI data to identify and exclude data with severe artifacts from further processing. An initial protocol compliance check is performed by extracting information from DICOM headers and checking for common issues and protocol deviations, such as missing files or incorrect patient orientation. Automated QC metrics are calculated from the image data. A deep learning model estimates motion artifacts for structural scans (T1w, T2w, and qMRI), while metrics related to motion, bad frames, line artifacts, and FOV (field of view) cutoff are assessed for dMRI, fMRI, and field maps. A subset of series are selected for manual review based on multivariate prediction and Bayesian classifiers using the automated metrics. During the manual review, data quality is scored based on the severity of specific artifacts. For structural scans, motion artifacts are scored based on perceived severity on a scale of 0 to 3. Scores indicate no artifact (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3). Other artifacts, such as unusual intensity inhomogeneity or ghosting are noted by the reviewer. For dMRI, fMRI, and field maps, scored artifacts include susceptibility artifacts, FOV cutoff, and line artifacts. Other artifacts may be noted. Series with severe artifacts that clearly compromise data usability are rejected (QC=0). Overview DICOM images are converted using a custom version of the dcm2niix tool that included bug fixes for some modalities acquired in HBCD. The MRI protocol is then checked in the produced NIfTI and JSON files in which certain exclusion criteria have been developed to ensure the quality of the data. For example, a check to ensure that all images are acquired using a head coil was performed before including it in the BIDS dataset. Other exclusion criteria will be detailed in each of the image type sections below. In some instances, the NIfTI and JSON files obtained from the dcm2niix conversion needed to be altered by in-house script to include additional header information. Those changes are listed below in each of the image type sections below. Any hard-coded headers are listed in the HardCodedValues field of the JSON sidecar file of the acquisition. T1w & T2w Anatomical Images The following images are located in the anat/ subdirectory and are accompanied by sidecar .json files that contain relevant header information about the acquisitions. Notes: For Philips T1W images, the RepetitionTime value obtained after the dcm2niix conversion was incorrectly set and needed to be hardcoded to reflect the actual repetition time of the acquisition.

Quantitative MRI Filename: sub-<label>_ses-<label>_run-<label>_inv-<label>_QALAS.nii.gz Depending on the scanner manufacturer, dcm2niix produced either 5 NIfTI 3D files or 1 NIfTI 4D file with 5 volumes. In addition, some header information was missing from the JSON file produced by dcm2niix . Therefore, we took the files produced by dcm2niix and generated the QALAS NIfTI files that can be found in the BIDS dataset. Therefore, each QALAS series results in 5 NIfTI files with different inversion time (labeled using the inv-<label> BIDS tag). In addition, JSON sidecar file needed to have the following headers modified: InversionTime values were hard-coded as follows: - 0 in the inv-0 QALAS file - 0.1 in the inv-1 QALAS file - 1 in the inv-2 QALAS file - 1.9 in the inv-3 QALAS file - 2.7 in the inv-4 QALAS file T2Prep was hard-coded as 0.1 in the inv-0 QALAS file Diffusion DWI images can be found in the dwi subdirectory located in the session folder, labeled as sub-<label>_ses-<label>_dir-<label>_run-<label>_dwi.nii.gz . The JSON sidecar file contains relevant header information about the acquisition. The label dir-<label> is used to distinguish between the DWI acquired in the AP phase encoding direction ( dir-AP ) and the DWI acquired in the PA phase encoding direction ( dir-PA ). Note: After dcm2niix conversion, Philips DWI files were missing PhaseEncodingDirection , TotalReadoutTime , and SliceTiming header information. These headers have been hard-coded into the JSON sidecar file for Philips DWI acquisitions. SmallDelta and LargeDelta header values have also been added to all DWI JSON sidecar files.

Description : The HBCD Study demographics survey is designed to gather comprehensive information on socioeconomic status and various demographic factors. Its primary purpose is to capture data on race, ethnicity, nativity, income, education, and occupation, as well as gender identity, sexual orientation, relationship status, primary residence, and household composition of the parent carrying the child, and some basic information on the other biological parent. From Cioffredi et al. 2024 : The HBCD Demographics survey was designed to collect social and economic information including race, ethnicity, nativity, income, maternal education, and occupation, as well as to characterize gender identity, sexual orientation, relationship status, primary residence, and household composition. The household composition matrix asks for details on all household members including age, gender, relationship to the child, relationship to the primary caregiver, and time spent caring for the child. Participants and families who endorse no primary residence, or that they are living in a shelter or treatment facility, are not asked to complete the household matrix. The survey includes a limited set of questions on the child\u2019s \u201cother biological parent\u201d (i.e., race, ethnicity, nativity, education, occupation), provided the respondent endorsed an item indicating that they could answer this set of questions. Although there are no direct questions about the primary caregiver\u2019s spouse/partner in the demographics, details of this relationship can be found within the household composition roster. The questions on Occupation ask for detailed information about exposures to environmental toxicants. Careful consideration was given to ensure that questions were inclusive of diverse populations and could capture a wide range of family structures and living situations that may impact child health outcomes. As a result, survey elements available within the PhenX Toolkit and other large-scale NIH studies were reviewed and modified by the Social and Environmental Determinants working group and the HBCD Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Committee to reduce bias and correct for embedded assumptions of heteronormative nuclear-family structures (see Table with sources below). Future demographics surveys will repeat survey elements from Visit 4 for both the primary caregiver and the child. Summary : Demographic information is crucial for understanding the child\u2019s environment and identifying how social, structural, and economic factors influence development over time in a longitudinal study of child development. By capturing detailed information, the Demographics survey provides key information on the child\u2019s context. Repeating these measures allows researchers to track changes and study these changes in relation to development.

A series of forced choice questions were used to elicit the responses and slide scales were used to assess the percentage of time a child is exposed to a given language in their various environments (i.e., home, daycare, other family member household, babysitter). Up to ten non-parental childcare arrangements were sampled. The measure was designed to inform the site\u2019s assessment team prior to assessments related to neurocognitive and language functioning. Responses are used to determine who was able to conduct the cognitive and language assessments (i.e., English or Spanish speaking) and to document additional challenges to completing assessments (hearing impairment, other languages). This was a questionnaire developed specifically for HBCD to inform assessment process. Caregivers opt for their child\u2019s assessment to be performed in either English or Spanish for in person performance tasks (i.e., NIH Baby Toolbox, Bayley-4, or Deferred Imitation) by selecting between a forced choice of English or Spanish.

Summary : This instrument involves a series of questionnaires that assess parental concern regarding the child\u2019s hearing and the presence of English, Spanish, or Other languages in the child\u2019s home and childcare environments. General Scoring Description and Procedure Non-parental childcare arrangements: For up to 10 non-parental childcare arrangements, total days per week and total hours per day were calculated from the sum of days/week and hours/day, respectively, spent in non-parental childcare arrangements: Daycare , With Babysitter , With other family members outside of the household , and Other non-parental childcare arrangement . Frequency of English and Spanish was quantified for each environment as follows: only in Spanish: child\u2019s language environment has >= 30% Spanish AND < 30% English only in English: child\u2019s language environment has >= 30% English AND < 30% Spanish in both languages (still pending Steering Committee voting): child\u2019s language environment has >= 30% Spanish AND >= 30% English neither Spanish nor English: child\u2019s language environment has < 30% Spanish AND < 30% Englis The total frequency of Spanish and English was then computed by multiplying the percentage of English and Spanish language provided per environment by the total hours per week in both the home and other care environments. The values are provided for home and for the overall total child experience, combining home and other care environments. Implementation & Data Collection Method of Administration : This measure is completed remotely by caregivers prior to when cognitive and language assessments will be performed. If the caregiver does not complete the assessment remotely, it is conducted at the visit to document the child\u2019s language exposure environments. The instrument can be administered by an RA in person or via video as needed.

It is adapted from the well validated IBQ-R Very Short Form, with additional items reflecting Behavioral Inhibition from the long form of the IBQ-R. Caregivers are asked to report on the infant\u2019s behaviors on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 7 (always). For the purposes of HBCD, the measure consists of 4 scale domains: surgency (13 items), negative affect (12 items), effortful control (12 items), and behavioral inhibition (13 items). Summary : The IBQ provides a comprehensive assessment of early temperament, focusing on key traits that influence development and behavior during the early years. General Scoring Description and Procedure : The IBQ-R+BI is scored in 4 domains: Surgency, Negative Affect, Effortful Control, Behavioral Inhibition. Respondents report on the frequency of infant\u2019s behavior using the following scale: 1 - Never 2 - Very rarely 3 - Less than half the time 4 - About half the time 5 - More than half the time 6 - Almost always 7 - Always 8 - (Does not apply/missing) Scale scores represent the mean score of all scale items applicable to the child, as judged by the caregiver and are computed as follows: Sum all numerical item responses for a given scale. Note that: If caregiver omitted an item, that item receives no numerical score If caregiver checked the \"does not apply\" or \u201cchoose not to respond\u201d response option for an item, that item receives no numerical score Divide the total by the number of items receiving a numerical response Do not include items marked \u201cdoes not apply (N/A)\u201d or \u201cchoose not to respond\u201d in determining the number of items. If >40% of items from a scale are missing (i.e., there are only 7/12 completed responses in a scale), it is not possible to score the individual domain For example, given a sum of 47 for a scale of 12 items, with one item receiving no response, two items marked \"does not apply,\" and 9 items receiving a numerical response, the sum of 47 would be divided by 9 to yield a mean of 5.22 for the scale score.

The MMN captures differences in neural responses to standard (\u201cba\u201d) and deviant (\u201cda\u201d) stimuli. From this task the MMN difference wave is computed, which is also known as the Mismatch Response (MMR). The amplitude/latency of this difference wave has been linked to language (Choudhury & Benasich, 2011), temperament/personality (Gurrera et al., 2001; Marshall et al., 2009), internalizing problems (Reeb-Sutherland et al., 2009), externalizing/attention problems (Gumenyuk et al., 2005), and disorders including autism (Lepist\u00f6 et al., 2005; Schwartz et al., 2018) and reading ability/dyslexia (Lepp\u00e4nen et al., 2010; Norton, Beach, et al., 2021). See Fox et al. (2024) for more information about the MMN task. Description : An auditory presentation of human syllables including \u201cba\u201d and \u201cda\u201d. A video is played on iPad as a distractor with brightness all the way up, in airplane mode, and not plugged in. The task runs for 11:30 minutes in V03 and 8:30 minutes in V04/6. The task may be paused if breaks are needed. Summary : The MMN task (v.11.29.23) provides a comprehensive assessment of infant speech sound processing. The measure includes rigorous QC procedures to ensure data integrity and reliability. Implementation & Data Collection Method of Administration : RA administered in person Child Specific/Unspecific Form : Child Specific Visits : V03 (3-9 months), V04 (9-15 months), V06 (15-48 months) Estimated length of time for completion : Approximately 11:30 minutes (V03) or 8:30 minutes (V04/6) Quality Control & Known Issues QC Procedures Data are cleaned and preprocessed using the Maryland Analysis of Developmental EEG (MADE) pipeline (Debnath et al., 2019) Ongoing QC monitoring via LORIS dashboard Rate quality of EEG cap application for each recording Site specific check ins and troubleshooting See Fox et al.

The MMN captures differences in neural responses to standard (\u201cba\u201d) and deviant (\u201cda\u201d) stimuli. From this task the MMN difference wave is computed, which is also known as the Mismatch Response (MMR). The amplitude/latency of this difference wave has been linked to language (Choudhury & Benasich, 2011), temperament/personality (Gurrera et al., 2001; Marshall et al., 2009), internalizing problems (Reeb-Sutherland et al., 2009), externalizing/attention problems (Gumenyuk et al., 2005), and disorders including autism (Lepist\u00f6 et al., 2005; Schwartz et al., 2018) and reading ability/dyslexia (Lepp\u00e4nen et al., 2010; Norton, Beach, et al., 2021).

VEP amplitude and latency decreases with age during the first three years of life. The VEP has been associated with concurrent and later developmental outcomes as a function of prenatal substance exposures (Margolis et al., 2024), early visual enrichment or deprivation (Jensen et al., 2019), vision system maturation (Lipp\u00e9 et al., 2009), neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., ASD and ADHD; Cremone- Caira et al., 2023; Nazhvani et al., 2013), and reading and learning disabilities (Shandiz et al., 2017). The morphology of the VEP likely reflects varying degrees of synaptic efficiency and as such, can be used as a readout of general cortical function. The task elicits a VEP response in the occipital area (Oz), consisting of the, N1 (first negative peak), P1 (first positive peak), and N2 (second negative peak) components. See Fox et al. (2024) for more information about the VEP task. Description : A flashing black and white checkerboard is shown for the duration of the task.

Participants were asked for each substance whether they had ever used it, and for those endorsed, a series of questions about disordered use or use causing problems in their lives. Information was obtained about modes of use specific to each substance. For example, for tobacco, participants were asked to report the type of product used, such as cigarettes or e-cigarettes. Likewise, participants who used cannabis were asked what types of products they used, such as smoking marijuana flower, vaping, or consuming edibles. If alcohol was reported during this period, the participant was further asked what type of alcohol they consumed (beer, hard cider, hard seltzer/wine/spirits).

Timeline Follow Back Measure Overview Full Name : Timeline Follow Back Acronym/Brief Name : TLFB Construct : Substance use before and during pregnancy Description : This was a created to capture maternal substance use before and during pregnancy Summary : Participants who reported any substance use in the three months before or during pregnancy were interviewed about their use of each substance with a TLFB approach. They were instructed to report their substance use during 9 weeks in total for each substance reported on the ASSIST, disaggregated into product type (e.g. edible cannabis products). The number of occasions of use per day was captured for all products except for cigarettes and cigarillos (number per day) and alcohol (number of single servings per day). The sampled weeks captured 9 weeks in total and were as follows: pre-pregnancy use (Weeks 1-2: four weeks before LMP through two weeks before LMP), early pregnancy use (Weeks 3-6: two weeks after LMP through six weeks after LMP), and current use (Week 7: the week prior to V1). The TLFB was repeated at V2 to capture substance use during the last two full weeks of gestation (Weeks 8-9). While for most participants, the TLFB was administered by study staff, at the site where prenatal substance use was reportable by study staff, participants received training to enter their use directly into the TLFB.

It is completely reasonable that someone could endorse a substance during pregnancy, and it doesn\u2019t appear on the TLFB because it didn\u2019t happen to fall within a sampled week. Similarly, they may have a positive biospecimen but no data on the TLFB for the same reason. Sampling (before, early, mid and late pregnancy) was meant to minimize participant burden (and not request a 40-week TLFB) but capture portions of pregnancy where behaviors tend to change (before and after pregnancy recognition, late pregnancy). Also of note- participants were asked to report occasions (except cigarettes/ cigarillos and drinks (number), but some substances (e.g. electronic cigarette devices) are difficult to report in occasions and have outliers. The TLFB data should be combined with the biospecimen and Assist data. One could also create trajectories of use from the TLFB with assumptions by using data on early pregnancy (weeks 3-6) carried forward until stated pregnancy recognition (V1 Health), then using enrollment (week 7) information and carrying that forward until late pregnancy (weeks 8-9).

Acronym/Brief Name : N/A Construct : motor behavior, physical activity, sleep Description : Axivity AX6 sensors were used to record infant leg movements across 72 continuous hours. One sensor was placed on the distal right ankle and one sensor was placed on the distal left ankle, using legwarmers with a pocket to hold the sensor. Sensors were set to start recording at 10 am eastern/9 am central/8 am mountain/7 am pacific. Caregivers were instructed to go about their typical activities but to remove the sensors if the baby went into water (e.g., bathtub or pool) and replace them afterward. The sensors were set to record accelerometer (acceleration, range of +/- 16 g) and gyroscope (angular velocity, rate of rotation, +/- 2000 dps) data continuously at 25 samples per second. From this, we can estimate how frequently and how vigorously an infant is moving his or her legs, including an estimate of sedentary physical activity, light physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous activity, or asleep. Before the 72 hours of data were collected, a calibration file was collected for each sensor. Instructions for collection of the calibration data were: There are 6 flat surfaces of the sensor and we want to record data with the sensor sitting still on each if its flat surfaces. To do this: place the sensor on a level, flat surface (e.g., the surface of a desk or table). Wait 10 seconds. Rotate it so that it is resting on its next flat surface. Wait 10 seconds. You should put the sensor in 6 different positions and collect 10 seconds of data in each position, so just over a minute of data in total (including the time to rotate it). It does not matter what order you do this in. I like to get the 4 longer sides and then the 2 shorter ends. It does not have to be an exact 10 seconds in each position, counting \u201c1-Mississippi, 2-Mississipi\u2026.10-Mississipi\u201d will be close enough! Data files included in the data release are raw sensor data in BIDS format for the calibration and 72-hour files for the right leg and the left leg, as well as files containing processed data outputs. All are described below in \u201cAdditional Information\u201d section. Summary : Wearable sensor data (accelerometer and gyroscope) were collected continuously across 72 hours from infants ankles to estimate how frequently and how vigorously an infant was moving and when the infant was asleep. Implementation & Data Collection Method of Administration : RA placed sensors on child at visit, sensors then worn while 72 hours of data were collected across typical activities in the natural environment. Visits : V02 (0-1 months) and V03 (3-8 months) Quality Control & Known Issues QC Procedures Raw data files were spot-checked during the data collection time frame. Only a small percentage of data files were randomly checked each week as the process was manual and visual. When checked, calibration files were checked for presence of adequate data for each of 6 axes and 72-hour files were checked for the presence of data, labeling of right and left leg, and sampling rate used. Common Issues Identified Common issues identified during QC processes included inadequate data for each of the 6 axes in calibration files (human error), missing data for calibration files (due to human error or technical difficulties), missing data for 72 hours (due to human error, technical difficulties, or parent/legal guardian declining to participate in this aspect of the study), sensors being removed for prolonged periods during the 72 hours, or incorrect sampling rate used during the 72 hour collection. If possible, errors were corrected (but this was not often possible). All issued occurred rarely overall and the majority of the data were judged to be present and correctly collected. Potential Issues Flagged by Subject Matter Experts No issues were found. However, users are reminded that accelerometer sensor timestamps drift over time, so even though the right and left leg sensors started recording at the same time and recorded for the same duration of time at the same sampling rate, one cannot assume that the time specified matches exactly between the 2 sensors. By our estimates, Axivity AX6 sensors recording at 25 samples/sec diverge from one another by a couple of seconds by the end of 72 hours, and the magnitude of this error increases over time. Further, offsets were different between different sensors, so a calibration procedure was used to adjust for this Oh et al. 2024).

Acronym/Brief Name : N/A Construct : motor behavior, physical activity, sleep Description : Axivity AX6 sensors were used to record infant leg movements across 72 continuous hours. One sensor was placed on the distal right ankle and one sensor was placed on the distal left ankle, using legwarmers with a pocket to hold the sensor. Sensors were set to start recording at 10 am eastern/9 am central/8 am mountain/7 am pacific. Caregivers were instructed to go about their typical activities but to remove the sensors if the baby went into water (e.g., bathtub or pool) and replace them afterward. The sensors were set to record accelerometer (acceleration, range of +/- 16 g) and gyroscope (angular velocity, rate of rotation, +/- 2000 dps) data continuously at 25 samples per second. From this, we can estimate how frequently and how vigorously an infant is moving his or her legs, including an estimate of sedentary physical activity, light physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous activity, or asleep. Before the 72 hours of data were collected, a calibration file was collected for each sensor. Instructions for collection of the calibration data were: There are 6 flat surfaces of the sensor and we want to record data with the sensor sitting still on each if its flat surfaces. To do this: place the sensor on a level, flat surface (e.g., the surface of a desk or table). Wait 10 seconds. Rotate it so that it is resting on its next flat surface. Wait 10 seconds. You should put the sensor in 6 different positions and collect 10 seconds of data in each position, so just over a minute of data in total (including the time to rotate it). It does not matter what order you do this in. I like to get the 4 longer sides and then the 2 shorter ends. It does not have to be an exact 10 seconds in each position, counting \u201c1-Mississippi, 2-Mississipi\u2026.10-Mississipi\u201d will be close enough! Data files included in the data release are raw sensor data in BIDS format for the calibration and 72-hour files for the right leg and the left leg, as well as files containing processed data outputs. All are described below in \u201cAdditional Information\u201d section. Summary : Wearable sensor data (accelerometer and gyroscope) were collected continuously across 72 hours from infants ankles to estimate how frequently and how vigorously an infant was moving and when the infant was asleep.","title":"Measure Overview"},{"location":"measures/sensors/wearable_sensors/#implementation-data-collection","text":"Method of Administration : RA placed sensors on child at visit, sensors then worn while 72 hours of data were collected across typical activities in the natural environment.

Only a small percentage of data files were randomly checked each week as the process was manual and visual. When checked, calibration files were checked for presence of adequate data for each of 6 axes and 72-hour files were checked for the presence of data, labeling of right and left leg, and sampling rate used. Common Issues Identified Common issues identified during QC processes included inadequate data for each of the 6 axes in calibration files (human error), missing data for calibration files (due to human error or technical difficulties), missing data for 72 hours (due to human error, technical difficulties, or parent/legal guardian declining to participate in this aspect of the study), sensors being removed for prolonged periods during the 72 hours, or incorrect sampling rate used during the 72 hour collection. If possible, errors were corrected (but this was not often possible). All issued occurred rarely overall and the majority of the data were judged to be present and correctly collected. Potential Issues Flagged by Subject Matter Experts No issues were found. However, users are reminded that accelerometer sensor timestamps drift over time, so even though the right and left leg sensors started recording at the same time and recorded for the same duration of time at the same sampling rate, one cannot assume that the time specified matches exactly between the 2 sensors. By our estimates, Axivity AX6 sensors recording at 25 samples/sec diverge from one another by a couple of seconds by the end of 72 hours, and the magnitude of this error increases over time. Further, offsets were different between different sensors, so a calibration procedure was used to adjust for this Oh et al. 2024).","title":"Quality Control &amp; Known Issues"},{"location":"measures/sensors/wearable_sensors/#additional-information","text":"Data files included in the data release are raw sensor data in BIDS format for the calibration and 72-hour files for the right leg and the left leg, as well as files containing processed data outputs.","title":"Additional Information"},{"location":"measures/sensors/wearable_sensors/#raw-data-calibration-files","text":"Full Name: sub-{dccid}_ses-{session number}_task-LeftLegMovement_tracksys-imu_acq-calibration_channels.json Acronym/Brief Name : LL-Calib-Channels-Ref Description : The reference frame in which the channels of the Inertial Measurement Unit sensor used to prepare sensor calibration dataset is represented (left leg movement): Anterior, Right, Superior each corresponding to X, Y, and Z axis.

Figure 1. Check for fully installed sequences in DEFAULT > Sequence Region > Customer Sequences > Default. Operation Instructions Operation instructions (a.k.a, SOP) can be found here Update History v2.2 (April 19, 2024) anat-t1w and anat-t2w now have the BOLD Add-In to enable connection to FIRMM fMRI and DWI scans have now all be configured to auto-open the inline display anat-t2w had its B0 Shim set to Standard v2.1 (June 30, 2023) SVS localizer protocols (axial and coronal) have been updated to reduce SAR: RF Pulse Type: Normal -> Low SAR Allowed Delay: 0 s -> 30 s [Axial] TR: 4630 ms -> 4700 ms [Coronal] TR: 1700 ms -> 1800 ms Coronal SVS localizer had its shim region set to automatic (and erroneously been set to a custom manual shim region before) anat-t1w had its TI changed from 1100 ms to 1060 ms (this had been incorrectly set in v2.0) v2.0 (June 20, 2023) [N4VE11] N4VE11 is no longer supported. All scanners must be upgraded to NXVA30A SP02 to run the v2.0 protocol. [NXVA30] DWI protocol was modified: Prescan Normalize turned on (Normalize -> Prescan) Dummy scans enabled before reference scans to reduce motion artifacts [NXVA30] SVS localizer protocol has been overhauled to improve registration with the structural scans in the spectroscopy analysis pipeline. SVS localizer was previously a single scan, but is now two separate scans: anat-t2w_desc-mrsLocAX and anat-t2w_desc-mrsLocCOR. [NXVA30] Separate SVS and HERCULES spectroscopy scans have now all been merged into a single sequence (ISTHMUS). [NXVA30] T2 structural sequence has been updated to improve contrast in infants based on consensus recommendation of the Structural MRI WG. Key changes include TR, TE, and echo train length. [NXVA30] T1 structural sequence has been updated to use compressed sensing acceleration to reduce scan time (previous versions used GRAPPA). [NXVA30] T1 and T2 structural sequences now have embedded vNavs that capture motion information during the scans. [NXVA30] T1 and T2 structural sequences now have distortion correction turned off (was previously set to 3D and saved separate uncorrected series). [NXVA30] There are now only 2 repetitions of the EPI field mapping sequences during the fMRI block (previously field mapping was repeated 3 times). v1.5.2 (April 1, 2023) [N4VE11] There are no changes to the N4VE11 protocol, so it remains at v1.4 but is included in the v1.5.1 directory. [NXVA30] The DWI protocol was again modified to have all derived images disabled except for FA Map. We previously tried to disable all derived images (see v1.5). However, a bug in the DWI sequence causes all derived images to be reenabled whenever the protocol is opened, unless at least one derived image is selected. v1.5.1 (March 16, 2023) [N4VE11] There are no changes to the N4VE11 protocol, so it remains at v1.4 but is included in the v1.5.1 directory. [NXVA30] Copy references settings were corrected for spectroscopy sequences in 32-channel protocol. Previously some scans copied the incorrect information, leading to runtime errors. [NXVA30] To assist in reproducible subject registration, the protocol folders have been set to: Table Mode -> Fixed Anatomy -> Brain v1.5 (January 25, 2023) [N4VE11] There are no changes to the N4VE11 protocol, so it remains at v1.4 but is included in the v1.5 directory. [NXVA30] Sequences were renamed to match their primary BIDS output [NXVA30] The following protocol changes were made to DWI scans: Prescan Normalize turned off (Normalize -> Off) All derived images (e.g., FA Map) turned off on Diff card Fat Saturation mode changed to enable RF saturation (Fat-Water Contrast -> Fat Saturation) [NXVA30] The following protocol changes were made to fMRI and topup scans to harmonize across vendors: FoV Read -> 224 mm Base Resolution -> 112 Echo Spacing -> 0.54 ms Bandwidth -> 2350 Hz/px [NXVA30] The SVS Localizer had its coronal slices increased from 1 to 5 to support better localization of relevant anatomy. [NXVA30] QALAS protocol changes: Distortion Correction -> Off Image Scaling -> 3.0 v1.4.1 (October 6, 2022) [N4VE11] There are no changes to the N4VE11 protocol, so it remains at v1.4 but is included in the v1.4.1 directory. [NXVA30] Corrected the automatic FOV-copying links for resting state fMRI in 32-channel protocol. [NXVA30] Added the \"Set Strategy To Fixed\" step to the start of the protocols, ensuring that the table remains stationary for the duration of the scan session. [NXVA30] Added the \"BOLD add in\" to the fMRI and DWI scans, pre-populated with default information to enable support for the FIRMM tablet. v1.4 (August 3, 2022) First release at NXVA30A [NXVA30] T2w_SPACE now uses CS factor of 4 instead of 2x2 GRAPPA [NXVA30 and N4VE11] Now include up-to-date diffusion direction files with the protocol. Also confirmed that diffusion protocol is using these up-to-date direction files. [NXVA30 and N4VE11] Changed default location of SVS voxel to isocenter and default alignment to transversal. v1.3 (July 14, 2022) Localizer_SVS has been changed to a HASTE-based protocol. v1.2 (June 28, 2022) SpinEchoFieldMap_AP, SpinEchoFieldMap_PA, and rfMRI_REST_PA, had the following adjustments to prevent triggering the peripheral nerve stimulation model: FOV 216 mm Matrix Size 108 pixels Bandwidth 2204 Hz/Px Echo Spacing 0.56 ms QALAS3d_1p3mm_R2 had its FOV unlinked from T2w_SPACE, and is now set manually. tfl_b1map is now set to default its FOV to follow QALAS3d_1p3mm. v1.1.2 (June 20, 2022) SpinEchoFieldMap_AP, SpinEchoFieldMap_PA, and rfMRI_REST_PA, corrected to have pure axial orientation for FOV (was previously angled T > C). v1.1.1 (June 16, 2022) DWI_pe2_AP correct to no longer wait for user before starting; this was missed in the previous v1.1 release. Corrected Localizer_SVS to have \u201cBody part examined\u201d set to \u201cBrain\u201d. This was missed in the previous v1.1 release. v1.1 (June 13, 2022) Replaced Localizer with Localizer_quiet, based on Baby Connectome Project localizer (with addition of \"Acoustic Noise Reduction\" filter) to reduce acoustic noise. FOV for QALAS3d_1p3mm_R2, tfl_b1map, and T1w_MPR have now been set to default to follow the FOV for T2w_SPACE. DWI_pe1_AP and DWI_pe2_AP have now been set to use their FOV as the default shim volume (was previously a manual volume). FOV of DWI_pe2_AP has now been set to default to follow FOV for DWI_pe1_AP. Default FOV of DWI scans has been moved to L0 P0 H6, matching initial fMRI FOV. PRESS35 and HERC sequences have now been set to use their voxel as the default shim volume (was previously a manual volume). PRESS35_unsupp and HERC_unsupp now have parameter Sequence > Common > Delta frequency set to 0.0 ppm (was previously -1.7 ppm). Voxel of PRESS35_unsupp, HERC, and HERC_unsupp have now been set to follow the voxel for PRESS35. Added Localizer_SVS before PRESS35 scan, to provide anatomical localizer for SVS sequence. This sequence is somewhat louder than Localizer_quiet, but is shorter and has greater axial coverage. In 64-channel protocol, tfl_b1map was moved up in scan order to follow QALAS3d_1p3mm_R2 (now matches 32-channel protocol). \"Wait for start\" has been removed from all sequences to ensure back-to-back play-through, minimizing silent \"gaps\". Positioning mode of all sequences has been set to FIX (previously had mix of REF and FIX modes) T2w_SPACE now has filter mode set explicitly, removing dependence on \"implicit filter\" settings on individual scanners. T2w_SPACE now has default image scaling set to 2 (was previously 1) DWI_pe1_AP and DWI_pe2_AP had their TEs set to 88 ms (was previously 87.40 ms) All scans have \"Body part examined\" set to \"Brain\". v1.0 (April 19, 2022) Initial release.
